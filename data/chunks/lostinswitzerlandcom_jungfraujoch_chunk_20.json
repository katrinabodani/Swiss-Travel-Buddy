And if you're up for adding some more thrill to the experience, you can always opt for a paragliding flight with my colleague Denis from the starting place above Mürren down to Stechelberg. I had the chance to fly with him in this area in February 2024 and absolutely loved it! Alternative 4: Glacier Express or Bernina Express Another option to see glaciers, mountains and the best that Swiss nature has to offer without visiting Jungfraujoch is on board a scenic train . I’ve written an extensive post about the Glacier Express and the Bernina Express here . They both a ccept all travel passes and might be a great way for you to see the best of Switzerland without heading to the Top of Europe. If you go for this option, please do yourself a favour and buy a travel pass. Riding the full Glacier Express from St. Moritz to Zermatt costs 152 CHF, which doesn’t include the compulsory reservation fee yet. With your Interrail / Eurail or Swiss Travel Pass , all you need to pay for is the reservation fee. Same"
