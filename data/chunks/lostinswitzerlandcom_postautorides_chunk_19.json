The trail is roughly 3 km long and very easy to walk. This concludes my list of 12 scenic Postauto rides in Switzerland. I hope it's inspired you to go beyond the beaten tourist track and take trips that the locals do. I'd love to know which ones you've tried so please leave me a note in the comments below."
