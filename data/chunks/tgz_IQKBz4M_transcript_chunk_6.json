All the way up there. Not sure if you can see those people. They look like little ants. Long way up. We made it to the lake. only took us about an hour from leaving our accommodation to the lake. So, let's go for a well-deserved swim. It's been such a beautiful afternoon. The water is absolutely gorgeous. So refreshing after a hike up the mountain. So, I think it's time to head back down the mountain, spend our last night in Cander, make some dinner, maybe do some painting, pack our bags, maybe watch the sunset. I think I will end this vlog here because there's nothing too exciting happening tomorrow. We're just driving to Zurich, spending the evening in Zurich, and then boarding our flight the next day to go down to Porto. So, I will see you guys in Porto."
