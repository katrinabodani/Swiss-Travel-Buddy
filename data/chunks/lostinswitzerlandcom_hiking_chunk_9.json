Getting to the starting point If you’re not within walking distance to your accommodation, which you usually aren’t, you’ve got three options. Hire a car, use public transport or catch a cable car. Hiring a car is always an option. But of course, the Swiss public transport system takes you to almost every corner of the country. Check Google Maps for any public transport stations (train or Postauto buses) near your starting point and look for your connection on the SBB app or website . Sometimes, it pays off to buy a ticket and jump on a cable car as well. That way, you can gain plenty of altitude while saving your energy for the hike awaiting you. But that entirely depends on the hike you’re planning and you’ve got total freedom to make the best choice for yourself. However remote the starting point of your hike, chances are there's a Postauto bus taking you there. 7. The dangers you need to be aware of Yes, we need to have that talk."
