Stanserhorn Day 4 (14-Jun-2024) – Mount Rigi & Luzern City Engelberg to Mount Rigi was around three hours one way ride. The plan was to take train from Engelberg to Luzern, the hop on to ferry from Luzern to Vitznau and finally a cog rail from Vitznau to Rigi Kulm, which was the last stop. On the way back, the itinerary was just as exciting: a train from Rigi Kulm to Arth Goldau, then another one to Luzern. After a bit of exploring in Luzern city, we’d make our way back to Engelberg. A day packed with trains, ferries, and stunning Swiss scenery—what more could we ask for? Engelberg – Vitznau – Rigi Kulm We left our Airbnb right on schedule and arrived at the Luzern train station, with the ferry boarding conveniently located just across the street. The 50-minute ferry ride was scenic and relaxing. Upon reaching Vitznau, the Rigi cog rail was already waiting for us right outside the ferry station.
