You will pass by some of the most dramatic scenery you have ever seen. The new road tunnels directly through the mountains, diverting around a large lake, making the ferry ride obsolete and the journey much shorter than it used to be. The Epic Security Guard for Baltit Fort If you are not coming from China, then your other option is to come from Islamabad via the Karakoram Highway , or, as the locals call it, the KKH. It takes a long 14-18 hours just to get to Gilgit, the first major city in the north. Do not be surprised if armed soldiers tag along with you for part of the journey through the Kohistan region. Crime here happens often. Suicide bombings, and violence towards westerners has happened, but is uncommon. Continuing north along the KKH from Gilgit, you are only a few hours away from Hunza Valley. View of Altit Town From Karimabad The Capital of Hunza Valley, Karimabad. Karimabad, also known as Baltit, is Hunza Valleyâ€™s ancient capital. Sitting high above, atop a green hill overlooking the valley, is Karimabad. Karimabad is filled with trinket shops, hiking shops, and decent accommodation, all left over from when tourism was an actual thing here. The shop owners are indeed optimistic that the tourists will one day return, as they should. Hunza Pakol Hat Maker I sat on my hotel balcony in Karimabad,"
