By the way, if you're travelling with a Swiss Travel Pass, you automatically own the Swiss Museum Pass as well. This gives you free entrance to all the places listed here . (Spoiler alert: Certain chocolate factories also count as museums and are included in this pass) 3.6 Slow down Travelling can be exhausting when you power through a ridiculously crammed itinerary.
