  "text": "carry documents proving your travel plans and financial means. Remember the Schengen 90-day rule. Your time in Switzerland counts toward your total Schengen stay. If in doubt, check with the Swiss embassy or consulate in your home country. Planning ahead ensures a smooth entry so you can focus on enjoying everything Switzerland has to offer. So even though it's a slightly tiring subject, it needs to be dealt with so you can focus on the more pleasurable parts of travel planning."
