  "text": "your travel sim card to stay connected in Switzerland There are a number of sim card providers with great data plans The WiFi situation in Switzerland WiFi access is generally easy to find in Switzerland, but it should not be your only plan for staying online. While most hotels and Airbnb apartments offer free WiFi , caf√©s and restaurants usually require you to ask for a password or log in with your phone number. This can be inconvenient when you only want to quickly check a map or message someone. Public WiFi access is improving. Major SBB train stations and airports such as Zurich, Geneva and Basel provide free WiFi with no registration required. That is a pleasant surprise compared to many European countries, where connecting to public WiFi usually involves entering an email or confirming your phone number. However, SBB trains do not offer WiFi on most domestic routes. Only a few international trains heading to countries like Germany or Italy have onboard internet. If you plan to travel around the country by train , bus or car , having your own mobile data connection is much more reliable. You can access free wifi at all major SBB train"
