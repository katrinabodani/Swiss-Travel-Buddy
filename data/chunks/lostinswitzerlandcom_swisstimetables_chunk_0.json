How do I find an alternative?\" These are all things I've heard from people who reached out to me in a personal 1:1 call . While Switzerland is blessed with an excellent public transport system , it also has its downsides. The sheer amount of options available is especially overwhelming for people visiting Switzerland for the first time. I've written a ton of articles about getting around in Switzerland . About the Swiss Travel Pass, the Swiss Half Fare Card, public transport in general, renting a car and so on... You can find an overview of all these articles here and I highly recommend browsing through a few to get a good idea of what to expect in terms of transportation in Switzerland. But for now, I'm going to take a closer look at Swiss timetables to help you understand how you can navigate this jungle once you're here."
