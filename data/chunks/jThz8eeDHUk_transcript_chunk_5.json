Write down in the comments below Look over there Lauterbrunnen is over there in the valley that you can see And here is Wengen The path was straight until now, but here, it splits into three These are the three paths we could take Take a look at what's written on the markings You can go either left or right for Leiterhorn We do not know which path to take We're thinking of taking this one There's a poster here that reads- Three horses are grazing here That explains the barbed wires here And this is Leiterhorn... maybe... Yes it is"
