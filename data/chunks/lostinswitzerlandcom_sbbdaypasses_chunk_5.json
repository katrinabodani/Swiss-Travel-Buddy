  "text": "This beauty allows you to travel across all of Switzerland with a total of four people. All at an unbeatable price of 80 CHF. Per group! It is tied to a few conditions, though, which I'll get to in a minute. But if you plan on visiting Switzerland with your friends, you don't even have to consider buying a Swiss Travel Pass or any of the other travel passes. This one will be the absolute best deal you'll find. So, to all my dear young budget-conscious backpacker friends out there: look no further than the Friends Day Pass Youth! Price 2nd class: 80 CHF Price 1st class : 120 CHF Time of validity: Valid on the day you bought it for (until 5:00 am the following day) Area of validity: Everywhere according to this map Cancellation policy: cancellable up to 24 hours in advance if bought here through Swiss Activities Conditions: valid for a group of up to four people travelling together Age restrictions: All members of the group have to be younger than 25 years old There are several more SBB Day Passes out there like the day pass for dogs, children or bikes. If you're interested in those,"
