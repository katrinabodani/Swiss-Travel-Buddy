From Chur, you can also take a ride on the Brambrüesch Cable Car, which whisks visitors from Chur up to the Brambrüesch Mountain Resort where panoramic views, scenic hikes, and mountain biking adventures await Why visit Chur when you travel Switzerland: Beautiful and historic city Some unique attractions like an H.R. Giger “Alien” themed bar Catch the Brambrüesch Cable Car to the Brambrüesch Mountain Resort Lugano And if you’re looking for a warmer Switzerland experience, I can definitely recommend heading to Lugano in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino in southern Switzerland. This city is known for its Mediterranean ambiance and gorgeous lakeside setting, with plenty to see and enjoy. While the shimmering waters of Lake Lugano are the centerpiece of the city’s natural beauty, there are also two different mountains to head up for epic scenery – Monte Brè and Monte San Salvatore , both offering panoramic views of Lake Lugano and the surrounding Alps. Within the city proper though, there are of course the requisite beautiful cobblestone streets, historic buildings, and vibrant piazzas, along with the Renaissance Cathedral of Saint Lawrence. Another highlight? Swissminiatur, a charming open-air park"
