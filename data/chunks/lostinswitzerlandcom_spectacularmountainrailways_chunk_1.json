  "text": "down by gondola or vice versa. The ticket is valid for both legs. If you like, you can throw a scenic boat ride across Lake Lucerne into the mix. This is what is called \"The Golden Round Trip\". And golden it is! On the first leg, you travel from Lucerne to Alpnachstad by boat. From there, you catch the cogwheel train (steepest one in the world, remember?) up to Mount Pilatus. Once you've seen enough, catch the gondolas back down to Kriens and travel back to Lucerne by bus."
