And then have just like a nice chill afternoon at home, read a book, do some painting, just get nice and cozy while we listen to the scorns. [Music] This was such a cool experience. It's like a hike and it takes you to all these waterfalls within the mountain. It was just absolutely incredible. Honestly, the footage that we got and it just does not do justice to how beautiful and just amazing nature is. Um, yeah, absolutely incredible experience. Would highly recommend. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning from Candace Stag. I have just been sitting on the deck reading my book and drinking my tea and just watching the sun slowly light up the mountains. It's just been absolutely gorgeous. The view is just breathtaking. I've never seen anything quite like this. I wish I could wake up like this every morning. We are heading up the mountain today. We're going to catch the cable car up and then go for a hike around the lake and then swim"
