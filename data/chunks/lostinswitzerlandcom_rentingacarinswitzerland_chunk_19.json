  "text": "to street parking, all cities and large towns have parking garages. Look for signs with a white “P” on a blue background. These garages are often the easiest option – albeit not cheap. Rates can be around 2 to 4 CHF per hour or more in cities. Every city has several parking garages. Some even have dynamic displays telling you if they're full or how many free spots are still available. When parking anywhere, be sure you’re not in a spot that’s reserved or requires a permit. Fines for illegal parking will find their way to you via the rental company, with an extra admin fee on top. Fueling up & gas stations Fuel stations are plentiful, especially along highways and in towns. Highways have rest stops with gas, restaurants and restrooms at regular intervals. Most stations are self-service . You pump first, then pay at the cashier or card machine. Many have 24/7 automatic pumps where you can pay by card. Make sure your credit card has a PIN, as automated machines sometimes ask for one. Unleaded petrol is “95” or “98” octane (labeled as such), and diesel is usually labeled “Diesel” or sometimes “Gazole”. By the way, Sunday"
