Of course, you can basically enjoy a great hike anywhere in the country you feel like walking but some of the best official hikes to experience in Switzerland include: The Haute Route : a classic alpine trek that traverses the Pennine Alps from Chamonix in France to Zermatt in Switzerland, offering views of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and other iconic peaks along the way The Five Lakes Walk in the Jungfrau Region : which offers breathtaking views of the Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau peaks reflected in crystal-clear alpine lakes The Panorama Trail in the Bernese Oberland : which winds through lush meadows and past traditional Swiss chalets with panoramic views of the surrounding mountains Admire epic lakes Along with mountains, cheese and chocolate, one thing that Switzerland has a lot of is beautiful lakes! From crystal-clear mountain lakes nestled amidst the Alps to serene lakeside retreats surrounded by picturesque landscapes, Swiss lakes are beloved destinations for all sorts of travellers. Whether you’re an outdoor enthusiast, a nature lover, or just seeking tranquillity, there will be a lake (or multiple lakes) for you. You can hike around them, picnic beside them or have fun in and on them!"
