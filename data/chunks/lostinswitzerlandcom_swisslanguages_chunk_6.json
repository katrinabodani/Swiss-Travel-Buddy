  "text": "you don't need to be fluent in any local language to visit, learning a few key phrases can go a long way in making connections and navigating daily life. If you're traveling to Zurich or Lucerne, learning some basic German (or Swiss German) can be useful. In Geneva or Lausanne, a few words in French will help. In Ticino, knowing a bit of Italian can make interactions smoother. If not, English will still get you far in most tourist areas. Otherwise, just use your hands and feet... That always helps and makes for some interesting interactions."
