My carrot salad reminded me why I should have paid more attention in physics class when our teacher explained the correlation between pressure and altitude. Bottom line, seal it or leave it. Or clean it… Wear good shoes and warm clothes . It’s cold up there. Especially inside the ice palace. Also during summer. Even more so in winter. If you’re as pale as me, I suggest wearing sunscreen as the sun can be quite aggressive at this altitude. Even more so when it’s reflected in the snow. Jungfraujoch is very popular and can get crowded. To avoid having to skip several trains to find a free spot, make a reservation beforehand. If you book your ticket through Swiss Activities , you'll automatically get that reservation because you'll be booking your specific time slot. You’d expect the souvenir shops in a place like Jungfraujoch to be a rip-off. But they’re actually not. In case you’re looking for an out-of-the-ordinary place to buy yourself a Swiss Army knife or some Lindt chocolate,"
