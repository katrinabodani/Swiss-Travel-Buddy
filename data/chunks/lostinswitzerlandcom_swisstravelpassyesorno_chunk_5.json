My personal favourite things about the Swiss Travel Pass To wrap this up, let me share with you some of my favourite parts about the Swiss Travel Pass: It lets you explore every corner of Switzerland by using one of the densest networks of public transport in the world. You’ll see that there’s absolutely no need for a car here and that you’ll still be able to see it all. All the scenic train rides in Switzerland are included. In some cases, you’ll need to add a seat reservation, though. But other than that, you’re good to go."
