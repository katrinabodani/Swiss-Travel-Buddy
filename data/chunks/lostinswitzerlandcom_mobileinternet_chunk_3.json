There are three main ways to stay connected in Switzerland: using an eSIM , a physical SIM card or a Pocket WiFi device . The best option depends on your phone compatibility, travel style and whether you plan to share the connection with others. An eSIM is a digital SIM card that you install by scanning a QR code. There is no shipping or waiting involved. If your phone supports eSIM, this is usually the fastest and most convenient option. A physical SIM card is a good alternative if your phone doesn’t support eSIM. These are still widely used in Switzerland and can offer better value, especially if you need calls and texts. You may need to wait for delivery or pick it up locally. A Pocket WiFi device allows you to share internet with multiple devices without replacing your SIM. This is perfect"
