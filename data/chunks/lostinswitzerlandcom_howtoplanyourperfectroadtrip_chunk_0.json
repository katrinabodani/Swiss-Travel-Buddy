  "text": "Switzerland is one of the best countries in Europe for a road trip – and not just because the roads are in excellent condition. You can start your day driving past palm trees in Ticino and end it surrounded by glaciers in the Bernese Alps. Whether you’re looking for high mountain passes, scenic lakeside drives or charming villages tucked into remote valleys, it’s all here and easy to reach by car. This guide walks you through how to plan a road trip through Switzerland , step by step. It’s meant for independent travellers who like organizing their own routes, but it’s also helpful if you’re considering a pre-designed package with hotels and itinerary already included. Buckle up and let’s get into it. Choosing your route The most important decision you’ll make when planning a road trip through Switzerland is what kind of route you want to follow. Because Switzerland is relatively small, even a short trip can cover a lot of ground – but you still need to be realistic. Trying to see the entire country in five days will leave you more tired than inspired. Start by thinking about what kind of landscapes or activities interest you most. Furka"
