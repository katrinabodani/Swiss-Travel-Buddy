  "text": "you have a specific plan. Geneva Airport’s rental desks are well-organized and you can easily drive into Geneva city (15 minutes) or head east along Lake Geneva towards Montreux or south into the Alps. Basel Airport (EuroAirport) Basel’s EuroAirport is interesting because it’s shared by Switzerland and France and very close to Germany. Like Geneva, it has a French sector and a Swiss sector. If you’re primarily visiting Switzerland, rent from the Swiss sector. If you have a multi-country trip including France or Germany, you might compare prices, but remember the vignette issue if you go Swiss highways. Basel itself is a great starting point if you plan to explore northern Switzerland or drive into the Black Forest region of Germany or Alsace in France. Major rental companies operate here as well. Basel Airport is also super handy for a car pickup. It's perfect for your trip to Switzerland, France or Germany Bern Airport and other regional airports Bern has a small regional airport with a few car rental options. There are also car rental services at Lugano Airport (Ticino) and St. Gallen-Altenrhein in the northeast. However, these airports are much smaller and not as commonly used by international tourists."
