Whether you're hiking in the Alps, exploring Swiss cities or enjoying winter sports, here’s everything you need to know to stay safe and healthy while visiting Switzerland. Health considerations in Switzerland Swiss healthcare system Switzerland has an excellent healthcare system with world-class hospitals and well-trained medical professionals. If you need medical assistance, you’ll find pharmacies in every city and town with many open late or offering emergency services. If you're looking for a 24/7 pharmacy, go to your nearest bigger train station. Especially in major cities, there are farmacies that are open around the clock. Hospitals and clinics provide high-quality care but medical treatment can be expensive if you don’t have insurance. Health insurance for travellers While Swiss residents are required to have health insurance, travellers should ensure they have adequate coverage. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) covers EU and EEA citizens for essential medical care but it’s still advisable to have travel insurance that includes medical expenses, especially if you plan on doing adventure activities like paragliding , canyoning or river rafting ."
