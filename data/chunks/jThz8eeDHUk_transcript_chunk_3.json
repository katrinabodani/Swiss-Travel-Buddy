  "text": "today. But we were unable to. So, we will go tomorrow We're wondering where to go now There is the peak of Jungfraujoch- the highest peak here We are thinking we could go here To reach there, we'll have to board a train that will take us to Kleine Sheidegg From there, we will have to board another train to go further up We were sitting in this restaurant for one hour. We had to release a new vlog They had WiFi. We do not have 3G in our phones So we released that. But look at the stunning view! Now, we're going hiking We realized that we did not have time to go to the top of Jungfraujoch but we're going hiking on that mountain -I can't walk backwards this fast! We asked how do we go up there and we need reservation to do so. So, we can't go here either *flashback- deja vu!* and the journey to go there is very long So, the information centre suggested a trekking site called Wengen It's not too far away- it is only 15 minutes from here But they said that it is a good trekking spot and the view"
