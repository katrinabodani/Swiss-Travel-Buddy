I’ll admit, Zurich isn’t my personal favourite place to visit if you’re limited on time, just because it is (at the end of the day) just a city. BUT if you’re itching for a city break, especially one that includes (pricey) retail therapy, then Zurich is a lovely choice for a city break. You can shop till you drop along Zurich’s famous Bahnhofstrasse, one of the world’s most exclusive shopping streets or gallivant through one of the city’s many notable museums, including the Kunsthaus Zurich, which houses one of the largest art collections in Switzerland. And if you’re itching for some nature, Zurich is a nice base for that as well – with options like a scenic hike or train ride to the top of Uetliberg Mountain, Zurich’s local peak, for panoramic views of the city, Lake Zurich, and the Swiss Alps. Why visit Zurich when you travel Switzerland: Beautiful yet walkable city, perfect for an urban break Lots of museums, shops and impressive architecture Lake and mountains for outdoor activities as well Bucket"
