The city model of Zurich in the Department of City Planning 3.4 Join a free tour of the Swiss Parliament Building Understanding the Swiss political system can be as difficult as nailing jelly to a tree. I could drift off into open waters here and start explaining our direct democracy and how our Head of State consists of seven people instead of just one person. But I won't. Instead, if you're interested in all those political questions and our Parliament Building, you can join one of their free Parliament tours. To reserve your spot, use this booking form . The Swiss Parliament Building regularly runs free tours. Don't miss this if you're interested in Swiss politics. 3.5 Visit a free museum With over 1.100 museums scattered across the country, anyone should be able to find something to their taste here. And the best part is that roughly a third of our museums are free . Not the big ones like Technorama in Winterthur or the Museum of Communication in Bern. But CERN in Geneva and the Nature Museum in Solothurn, for instance, are free to enter. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a conclusive list"
