  "text": "highest village in Switzerland: Andeer to Juf (Photo: PostAuto AG) The beautiful region around Juf Juf is the highest place in Switzerland accessible by Postauto. It lies at 2126 metres above sea level and is also Europe's highest permanently inhabited settlement. Its population is quite small, though. Only 30 people call Juf their home. But who's counting, right? ðŸ˜‰ After leaving Andeer, you first pass through the Roffla Gorge, followed by the Ferrera Valley. During this journey, you get to enjoy beautiful scenery as you climb up to Juf. Spend some time exploring and hiking in Juf before catching the Postauto back down to Andeer. Travel time: 51 min (Andeer, posta - Avers, Juf) Schedule: Operating all year round Reservation: Not required Price return ticket without discount: 34.40 CHF Postauto Line: 552 My tip for you: Have you ever seen a marmot? Those cute, alpine animals are native to this region and there's even a Marmot Trail in Juf. On this unique signposted nature trail, you can learn everything there is to know about these cute hibernators. The trail is roughly 3 km long and very easy to walk. This concludes my list of 12 scenic Postauto rides in Switzerland."
