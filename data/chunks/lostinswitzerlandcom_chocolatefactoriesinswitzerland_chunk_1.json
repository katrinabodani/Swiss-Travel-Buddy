  "text": "check it out ðŸ˜€ You can visit House of LÃ¤derach either with a guided tour or on your own. In my opinion, both options are a fantastic opportunity to learn everything about their history as well as the chocolate-making process. They even have a viewing room inside the factory , from where your tour guide explains what is happening in which machine. The highlight of the visitors' centre has to be the three-part chocolate fountain â€“ which has dark, milk and white chocolate streaming down the same fountain."
