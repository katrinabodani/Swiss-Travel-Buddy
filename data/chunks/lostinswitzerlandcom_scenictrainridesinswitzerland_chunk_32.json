Here's some inspiration for things to do in Lucerne if you have time before your panoramic journey. The Chapel Bridge is iconic to Lucerne. View over Lake Lucerne and Mount Pilatus Lake Lucerne If you start in Lucerne, the first leg of the journey will be spent on Lake Lucerne. Even though you're on the boat for a few hours, you most likely won't get bored. The views are stunning and there's lots to see around here. If you happen to travel on a sunny summer day, chances are you won't get tired of the deep blue colour of the lake, either. ðŸ˜‰ Cruise across Lake Lucerne on a steam boat. I can almost promise you won't get bored of the views. On the ride across to FlÃ¼elen, youâ€™ll pass by several places of importance in Swiss history. For one, youâ€™ll see the RÃ¼tliwiese, Switzerland's alleged founding place. You'll also catch a glimpse of places like the Schiller Stone and the Tell's Chapel. According to legend, our national hero, William Tell, escaped the fangs of his enemy at Tellsplatte by jumping off his boat."
