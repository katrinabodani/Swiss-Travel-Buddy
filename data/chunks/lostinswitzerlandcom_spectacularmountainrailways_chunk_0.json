  "text": "If you're headed up to Mount Pilatus, you'll be travelling on the world's steepest cogwheel train, which starts in Alpnachstad near Lucerne . It reaches a 48% incline at its steepest section, which is crazy if you consider that it's been going up and down these tracks since 1889. Of course, the trains have been renewed in the meantime. But the steepness remains the same. Another way to reach Mount Pilatus is by gondola from Kriens. First, the small panoramic cable car takes you to Fränkmüntegg, where you'll need to transfer to the \"Dragon Ride\". This fancy-looking gondola has room for 55 people and lets you enjoy the view through its massive windows that go all the way to the floor. Since there are two different ways to get to Mount Pilatus, I recommend you combine your options to make the most of your trip. Travel up by cogwheel and down by gondola or vice versa. The ticket is valid for both legs. If you like, you can throw a scenic boat ride across Lake Lucerne into the mix. This is what is called \"The Golden Round Trip\". And golden it is! On the first leg, you travel from Lucerne"
