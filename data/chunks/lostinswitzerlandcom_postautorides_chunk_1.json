  "text": "a country that makes up only 0.08% of the world's surface. You get the picture. There are a lot of Postautos roaming our streets. While they can be seen in cities, they're more frequent in rural areas and mountain villages. Which comes with a nice side effect: Lots of Postauto rides are very scenic. If you're keen on seeing Switzerland from a different perspective and visiting places you might not come across without a Postauto, this article will provide you the the right inspiration. But before we dive in, here is some general information that goes for every Postauto ride you're about to discover: If you have a Swiss Travel Pass , all rides are fully included and you travel for free. The same goes for all the SBB Day Passes . No extra tickets are required. If you have a Swiss Half Fare Card , you receive a 50% discount on all tickets. Unfortunately, Interrail and Eurail passes aren't accepted on Postauto. So you won't get a discount. ALWAYS check the timetable in the SBB app or on the website to make sure you know your departure times! 1. Palm Express: St. Moritz to Lugano across the Maloja Pass"
