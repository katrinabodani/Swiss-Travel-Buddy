It’s around here that you cross the language border between the Romansh-speaking Engadine and the Italian-speaking Poschiavo Valley. The Bernina Express at Ospizio Bernina Bernina Express train Valposchiavo The Poschiavo Valley in the southern Alps is a fantastic place to go hiking or enjoy a walk along the lake. It’s where the Bernina Express crosses the Swiss-Italian border and takes you to Tirano, where you transfer to the Bernina Express Bus to Lugano. But before that happens, you pass one more highlight... Lago Bianco on the way to Valposchiavo Lago di Poschiavo Brusio Circular Viaduct The circular viaduct in Brusio is another spectacular construction on the Bernina Line. In order to overcome the altitude in the narrow Poschiavo Valley, the train has to take a 360-degree turn. Shortly after crossing this piece of art, you will cross the border and reach Tirano in Italy. Here, you can either head back to St. Moritz on the next train after spending some time in the city or continue on to Lugano by Bernina Express Bus.
