Getting off along the way : I don't recommend interrupting your Bernina Express journey as you need a reservation for this trip. Especially if the train only runs once a day, like it does during winter. If you really want to stop over, I recommend not travelling on the Bernina Express train but using the regular trains that run frequently between Chur, St. Moritz and Tirano.
