  "text": "see, Switzerland offers a wide range of payment options, from traditional cash to digital wallets. What I recommend is using a mix of cash and a credit or debit card. This way, you're always prepared if one means of payment isn't accepted. Before travelling, check with your bank about fees and international compatibility to ensure smooth transactions during your trip."
