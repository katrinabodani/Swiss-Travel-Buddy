  "text": "beside it is the tallest waterfall here in La Brennan. one of the tallest waterfall in Europe which stands 300 m tall and it is just so stunning cuz this is the picture you see everywhere on social media and to be standing here right now it's pretty crazy. So we're walking around the valley and everywhere you turn is just so picturesque. I can't even believe I'm here. This is definitely a pinch me moment for both Jan and I. I feel like I'm in a painting. Like I've been transported into a painting. As you guys know by now, Jan and I always start our mornings off with coffee. I can't function right now. I need coffee. Jan had coffee at the Airbnb cuz it's free. A cappuccino is 7.5. I'm guessing that's for the large. 12 Canadian. So that's a no. All right, guys. So, we're currently in the supermarket. We found some coffee here. This is all we can afford. It's definitely a little cheaper in the supermarket. We just need some caffeine. Their large coffee is 370 Swiss Franks. Still pricey, but we need our coffee. [Music] So, we're here now beside the Stoach Waterfall."
