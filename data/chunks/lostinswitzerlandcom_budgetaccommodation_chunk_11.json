  "text": "up with people I met during previous travels and reminiscing about our time together on the road is always a winner. Do you have any Swiss friends? Don’t be shy to get in touch with them. If you let them know you’re coming over, they’re likely to give you one of the following answers: \"You’re coming to Switzerland? Good for you. Have fun.\" (Not exactly what you’re looking for, but fair enough.) \"You’re coming to Switzerland? Awesome! Let’s meet up while you’re here.\" (Sounds better already, doesn’t it?) \"You’re coming to Switzerland? Cool! Let me know when you’re here. You can stay with me.\" (Jackpot! Spend some time with a friend AND save money at the same time? Happy days.) Whichever of these ways to spend the night you pick, they're definitely going to be cheaper than staying in a fancy hotel. Except for maybe the glamping part. If you have any additions to this list, please share it in the comments below. Sleep tight.
