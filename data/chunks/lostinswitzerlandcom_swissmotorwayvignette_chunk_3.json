How to use the Swiss Vignette For the physical vignette , it must be affixed to the inside of the windshield , ideally in the lower-left or center area near the rearview mirror. If it’s not properly attached (e.g., just placed on the dashboard), it is not considered valid and you risk a fine. For the digital vignette , you must register your vehicle’s license plate online when purchasing it. The system will automatically recognize your registration when driving on Swiss highways. By the way, this is only one of the many Swiss traffic rules you should be aware of when driving in Switzerland. What happens if you don’t have a vignette? Driving on Swiss highways without a valid vignette can result in a hefty fine of CHF 200 , plus you’ll still have to buy a vignette on top of that."
