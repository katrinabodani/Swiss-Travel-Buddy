(You can find a selection of spectacular mountain railways in Switzerland in a separate post, if you're interested.) 1. The Golden Pass Line The Golden Pass Line connects the centre of Switzerland with the shores of Lake Geneva. This spectacular journey leads past eight lakes , passes through six different cantons (the Swiss version of states), crosses three mountain passes and connects two language regions with each other. And it offers about an estimated gazillion photo opportunities. 191 kilometres (119 miles) Interlaken and (depending on the connection) Zweisimmen Trains run eight times a day, all year round. If you travel in 1st or 2nd class , you don't necessarily need a reservation to use the Golden Pass trains. However, during busy times, it is recommended to get a seat reservation to make sure you get your spot. Especially between Interlaken and Montreux. If you wish to travel in the Prestige Class between Interlaken and Montreux, a reservation is required. You can book your seat reservation for the Golden Pass Line in just a few clicks on Swiss Activities."
