  "text": "The costs for your accommodation add up quickly. Especially when you travel in an expensive country like Switzerland. Luckily, there are several ways to save (at least some) money on accommodation while you're here. Ready to find out what they are? 1. Stay in hostels 1.1 Hostels in general Hostels are an all-time classic with backpackers. They’re an excellent place to meet people, share crazy travel stories, get advice from fellow travellers or finally tackle that smelly laundry so you can stop running around with flies following you everywhere. Most of all, hostels allow you to save a considerable amount of money since you’ll be sharing a room with other people. Usually, a dorm sleeps between four and ten people and you can either choose to stay in a gender separated dorm or in a mixed dorm. What I love about hostels is the free stuff they often come with. Be that a weekly rooftop barbecue, free breakfast, the odd yoga class, a public transport ticket or a free walking tour around town. To book a hostel, you have a wide selection of websites at your fingertips. The ones I like to use when I travel are Booking.com and Hostelworld"
