  "text": "Swiss traffic rules you should be aware of when driving in Switzerland. What happens if you don’t have a vignette? Driving on Swiss highways without a valid vignette can result in a hefty fine of CHF 200 , plus you’ll still have to buy a vignette on top of that. Police and highway officials frequently check vehicles, so it’s not worth the risk. Are there any additional toll roads in Switzerland? While the Swiss vignette covers most highways, a few specific tunnels and alpine passes require additional tolls . These toll roads operate separately from the vignette system, meaning you must pay an extra fee when using them. Here are some of the most notable toll roads in Switzerland you might come across during your scenic road trip : Great St. Bernard Tunnel: This tunnel connects Switzerland with Italy and requires a toll. A one-way trip costs around CHF 30–50 , depending on the vehicle type. A round-trip ticket is slightly discounted if purchased together. Munt la Schera Tunnel: This single-lane tunnel connects Switzerland with Livigno, Italy, and operates on a time-controlled alternating traffic system. The toll fee is around CHF 15–20 per vehicle and tickets must be purchased before"
