[Music] We had such a beautiful morning out at Blair Sea. It was so gorgeous. We just kind of sat by the lake, had a little picnic, read our books, played some card games. We are home now. We've just been resting for a little bit, and we've decided, seeing as it's our last day, it's beautiful weather, we're going to go for another hike. We're actually going to hike back up to the lake that we were at yesterday. Instead of catching with her car, we're going to do the hike. I think it should take about an hour and a half. And so, we should get there for around 5:00, go for a swim, hang out for a little bit, and then come back down the mountain and make some dinner before bed. Then, we're off to Zurich tomorrow for our last day in Switzerland before making our way to Porto. [Music] That's where we're going. All the way up there. Not sure if you can see those people. They look like little ants."
