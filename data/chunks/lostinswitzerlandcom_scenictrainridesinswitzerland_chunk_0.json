Switzerland only measures 220 by 348 kilometres, which results in a very manageable landmass of roughly 41.000 square kilometres. That’s only half the size of Lake Superior in the US/Canada. Or 2.5 times the size of Beijing. Yet, if you sum up all the railway tracks running across the country, you’ll end up with a total of over 5.200 kilometres . That’s a lot. That’s the distance from Vancouver to Halifax. Or from Ushuaia to São Paulo. Or from Cairns to Sydney. Return! You get the idea. The Swiss are big on trains. So it comes as no surprise that, in a place that is often associated with amazing scenery, a handful of these 5.200-odd kilometres are quite appealing to the eye. Regardless whether you plan a road trip or an epic train journey. In this post, I’ll introduce you to the five most scenic and best train rides in Switzerland . Mountain railways excluded. (You can find a selection of spectacular mountain railways in Switzerland in a separate post, if you're interested.) 1. The Golden Pass Line The Golden Pass Line connects"
