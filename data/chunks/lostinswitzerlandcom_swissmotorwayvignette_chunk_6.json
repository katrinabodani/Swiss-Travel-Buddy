  "text": "run frequently. Gotthard and San Bernardino Tunnels: These tunnels are covered by the vignette, meaning no additional tolls apply. However, during peak travel times (especially summer weekends), expect heavy traffic and possible long delays. If your route includes any of these tunnels or car trains, itâ€™s a good idea to check current toll rates and operating hours in advance to avoid surprises. You now know everything you need to be prepared for your Swiss road trip. Whether you opt for the traditional sticker or the new digital vignette, make sure you have one before hitting the road to avoid fines and enjoy a smooth driving experience in Switzerland."
