If you only find them at higher prices, just buy a Swiss Travel Pass instead. 3. Friends Day Pass Oh to be young again. And travel through Switzerland for only 20 CHF a day! This is possible for everyone that hasn't reached their 25th birthday yet. The Friends Day Pass is valid for up to four (young) people travelling together. And it only costs 80 CHF in 2nd class and 120 CHF in 1st class. It's the absolute best value any backpacker can ever get in Switzerland for their money. Forget about the Swiss Travel Pass and just get a Friends Day Pass for each day you catch a train, bus, tram or boat. All you need to do is grab the ticket and off you go. Enough said. It's the best thing the SBB has ever invented in my opintion. 4. Supersaver Ticket This one doesn't necessarily make your life easier. But it is technically an option. The Supersaver Ticket, like the Saver Day Pass, comes with dynamic prices. The earlier you buy it,"
