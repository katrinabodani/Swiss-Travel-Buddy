In some cases, you’ll need to add a seat reservation, though. But other than that, you’re good to go. I love how the Swiss Travel Pass includes over 500 museums. My top picks are the Maestrani Chocolarium near St. Gallen, Chillon Castle by Lake Geneva, the Gruyère cheese factory, Maison Cailler in Broc and the Ballenberg Open-Air Museum near Brienz. With Switzerland being the „water castle of Europe“, it comes with quite a few lakes . And therefore the possibility to jump on a boat to explore the area. My favourites are Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. But the Swiss Travel Pass is valid with almost all other boat companies running across our lakes as well. The boats on Lake Thun are included in your Swiss Travel Pass. Chateau de Chillon by Lake Geneva near Montreux is one of my favourites. I hope this post has helped you in the process of deciding whether or not you should buy a Swiss Travel Pass. Happy planning and good luck making"
