But if you’re happy with their original flavour, the supermarket will do the trick as well. \"Basler Läckerli\" are worth the risk of chipping a tooth. 5. Kägi Fret What is it? These chocolate covered waffles are another snack most Swiss carry with them when they go hiking. Kägi fret come in different flavours like orange, coconut and even Japanese matcha. Personally, I prefer the original ones over those fancy creations. And yes, I’m aware that I just slipped up with my no-chocolate principle. Sorry. Where can you buy it? You can buy Kägi fret almost everywhere. Supermarkets, grocery stores, kiosks and most mountain restaurants sell them. “Kägi fret”, another Swiss classic, is a great companion for your hike. 6. Weggli und Brügeli What is it? Every Swiss knows this iconic mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack from their childhood. It consists of a Weggli (white bread roll) and a Brügeli (chocolate bar). It’s way less heavy and stuffing than a Biberli and makes for a great light snack. Apologies for my repeated sloppiness in the no-chocolate sector. But the Weggli und Brügeli is one I just couldn’t leave unmentioned."
