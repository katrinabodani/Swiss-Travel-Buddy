  "text": "when you'll be travelling. The Saver Day Pass entitles you to unlimited travel across Switzerland, like the Swiss Travel Pass does. (This also includes the five most popular scenic trains in Switzerland , by the way.) Except that it's a lot cheaper if you book it early enough. Its prices are dynamic. So the pass becomes more expensive the more spontaneously you buy it. As you can see, it pays off to be quick here. The lowest possible price for a Saver Day Pass in combination with a Swiss Half Fare Card is 29 CHF for a 2nd class ticket and 52 CHF if you don't have a Swiss Half Fare Card. Once the cheapest tickets are sold out for a specific date, the next lowest price becomes available. And so on. You can buy the Saver Day Pass six months ahead of time. You give up some flexibility by getting it as it's only valid on a specific date. But it's absolutely worth it and I never plan a trip with friends from overseas without checking for a good deal on this pass first. Things to be aware of if you opt for the Saver Day Pass: This ticket"
