Perfect for people-watching, grabbing a snack or attending one of Zurich’s seasonal festivals. 7. Chill out at Chinawiese A popular riverside park where locals gather in summer to swim, sunbathe and picnic. It’s one of the most relaxed corners of the city. 8. Take a closer look at Zurich Main Station More than just a transport hub, the Hauptbahnhof is home to a shopping mall, seasonal markets and is an architectural landmark in its own right. 9. Go on a river cruise on the Limmat River Between spring and autumn, small boats navigate the Limmat through the city centre, offering a peaceful ride past church towers, historic buildings and leafy parks. 10. Visit Markthalle at Viadukt A trendy market hall built into the arches of a railway viaduct. You'll find everything from artisan food stalls to indie fashion and design shops. 11. Relax at Hürlimann Spa Set in a former brewery, this rooftop thermal spa is one of Zurich’s most relaxing experiences. The rooftop pool offers panoramic city views,"
