  "text": "Speaking of the cathedral, the views from the top of its tower are fantastic. On a clear day, you can see the Bernese Alps in the south, including the famous mountain-trio Eiger, MÃ¶nch and Jungfrau. To the north you can admire the Jura mountains with Weissenstein, Solothurn's backyard mountain. Not that it classifies as a mountain in my eyes, but thatâ€™s a story for another day. This has been an ongoing debate between me and my local friends since the day I moved hereâ€¦ I guess youâ€™ll have to form your own opinion here ðŸ™‚ In addition to these alpine views, you have the River Aare and the entire old town at your feet. I always find it fascinating to check out those rooftop terraces and watch the city from a bird's-eye view. The tower is open from April through October . Once youâ€™ve climbed the 249 steps, you can buy your ticket (3 CHF) from the friendly person awaiting you at the top. Oh, and in case youâ€™re a little disappointed that you canâ€™t divide 249 by eleven, youâ€™re not the only one."
