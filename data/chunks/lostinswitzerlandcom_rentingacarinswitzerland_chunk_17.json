Parking Parking rules in Swiss towns can be a little confusing at first, but they’re manageable once you know the system. Many areas use a color-coded zone system. Blue zones are common in city centers. These allow free parking for a short duration, typically up to 1 hour, during the day.

Blue zone timings are usually Monday to Saturday during business hours, usually from 8:00 to 19:00. Outside of those times you might be able to park longer, even overnight, for free. Always check the signs. Blue zones are indicated with the blue P-sign you see in the picture. They're very common in housing areas in cities. White zones generally"
