All right, so we still have 3 hours till we get to our Airbnb in La Brennan. So we're going to gas up right now. First time gasing in Switzerland. Check this off the bucket [Music] list. All right, let's go check out what they have in their gas station. Wa! Look at this Switzerland. That is so sick, babe. Look. Oh, there's Ann. Look at this keychain. Bathroom is so nice in here. It's also expensive, â‚¬1 to enter the bathroom. But wow, we're officially in Switzerland, guys. A nail cutter cuz you always need one. Oh, look at the magnets, babe. Dude, I can't believe I'm here. Look at their chocolate, too. Swiss Dreams, dude. I'm so intrigued cuz it's Anna's first time here. I think they're known for chocolate, so we definitely have to bring some home. Yeah, definitely. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hello. All right, so we just stopped for a washroom break. Look at this, guys. We're already surrounded by mountains. Everything's so luscious. There's like cows"
