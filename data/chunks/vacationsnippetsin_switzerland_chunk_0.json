Multiple Instagram reels and vlogs helped us weave our itinerary. Additionally, a few office friends who had visited Switzerland before gave us valuable suggestions and essential information. As our travel day neared, I couldn’t help but feel the childhood nostalgia of “ Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge ” and “ Darr ,” both movies were filmed in Switzerland’s stunning locations. I recently rewatched both movies and began imagining myself in those green meadows of the Swiss valley, enjoying the gentle cool mist caressing my face.
