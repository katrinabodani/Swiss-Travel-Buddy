For instance, you could enjoy a few days in Zurich using public transport, then pick up a car in the city to head out to the countryside. One thing to consider: downtown locations may have shorter opening hours than airports, which often have 24/7 or late-night service. Always check the pickup and drop-off times and whether the office is open on Sundays. Many are closed on Sunday in Switzerland or have very limited hours.

Zurich main station, Geneva Cornavin, Basel SBB, Lausanne, etc. often have rental kiosks or offices either in the station or a short walk away. This is super convenient if you’re coming in by train from another country or another Swiss city and want to transition to driving. You can often coordinate a one-way rental easily between train station locations and airports. Cities like Zurich have lots of car rental places nearby. They're very easy to reach if you arrive in a city by public transport. One-way rentals within"
