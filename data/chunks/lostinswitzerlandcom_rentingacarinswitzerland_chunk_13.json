Speed limits & traffic cameras Speed limits are strictly enforced . The typical limits are 120 km/h on highways, 80 km/h on rural roads and 50 km/h in urban areas, unless signs state otherwise. In many residential areas, you’ll even find 30 km/h or 20 km/h zones. Switzerland has an extensive network of speed cameras (both fixed and mobile), and fines for speeding are hefty . Driving 56 km/h instead of 50 km/h in urban areas costs 120 CHF! It’s not just a slap on the wrist. Extreme speeding can even get you in legal trouble. So, enjoy the drive but keep an eye on those speed signs. Stick to the speed limit Not"
