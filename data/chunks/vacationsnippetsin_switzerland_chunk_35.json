Luckily, we were traveling light—no luggage to slow us down. We reached Zermatt by 11am. It is a small town surrounded by mountains and famous for skiing. From outside the train station we boarded bus no. 571 which took us to the base of cable car for Matterhorn, from where the real adventure began! Zermatt Town Matterhorn Gandola Ride There were three cable cars to be taken. The first gondola whisked us up to Furi at 1640 meters, offering a spectacular bird’s eye view of Zermatt village below. Next, we hopped on the second gondola, climbing from Furi to Trockener Steg at 2939 meters, soaring over a rugged, rocky alpine wonderland. The grand finale? The third gondola, taking us from Trockener Steg to Klein Matterhorn, also known as Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. Matterhorn Gandola Matterhorn Summit The views from the 360-degree panorama platform at Matterhorn Glacier Paradise were absolutely jaw-dropping. Snow-covered mountains and glaciers stretched as far as the eye"
