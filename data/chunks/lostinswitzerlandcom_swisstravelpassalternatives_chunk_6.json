  "text": "you go. Enough said. It's the best thing the SBB has ever invented in my opintion. 4. Supersaver Ticket This one doesn't necessarily make your life easier. But it is technically an option. The Supersaver Ticket, like the Saver Day Pass, comes with dynamic prices. The earlier you buy it, the cheaper it is. So in case you already know exactly when you'll be catching wich train, checking for Supersaver Tickets can pay off. They're available six months in advance and you can save up to 70% if you're lucky. The biggest downsides are that Supersaver Tickets are non-refundable and tied to a specific train journey. But if you don't mind that, then looking into this ticket is a good idea. I've found some serious bargains that have saved me big time in the past. Things to be aware of if you opt for the Supersaver Ticket: You can only use the Supersaver Ticket on the exact train you bought it for. If the train gets cancelled or you miss it without it being your fault, tell a staff member as soon as possible and they'll give you a confirmation so you can catch the next available train. The easiest"
