  "text": "It consists of a Weggli (white bread roll) and a Brügeli (chocolate bar). It’s way less heavy and stuffing than a Biberli and makes for a great light snack. Apologies for my repeated sloppiness in the no-chocolate sector. But the Weggli und Brügeli is one I just couldn’t leave unmentioned. Where can you buy it? Supermarkets usually have a handful of Brügeli very close to their bread section. As do bakeries, by the way. So many Swiss childhood memories are attached to this one... 7. Berliner What is it? Berliner aren’t typically Swiss but we love them as much as the Germans and Austrians do. They’re deep fried balls of yeast dough, filled with jam and topped with icing sugar. My online dictionary calls them “jam doughnuts”. I’ll let that pass. Where can you buy it? Supermarkets as well as bakeries sell Berliner. Needless to say that the ones from the bakery taste better. “Berliner” are like a jam sandwich. Just better. 8. Birewegge What is it? Birewegge are puff pastry rolls filled with a mixture of dried pear, concentrated pear juice, nuts and loads of sugar. Where can you buy it? You can buy Birewegge either at the supermarket,"
