It’s a slightly shorter variation of the Grand Tour of Switzerland, ideal for those looking for a compact itinerary with a lot of variety. What’s special about it? This route blends alpine driving with cultural stopovers and relaxed city stays. You’ll experience the baroque old town of St. Gallen, drive winding roads over the Julier and San Bernardino passes, and enjoy the lakeside atmosphere and Italian-speaking flair of Lugano. Along the way, you’ll also pass the Rhine Falls – Europe’s largest waterfall – and traverse parts of the Gotthard and Grimsel regions before reaching Lucerne. It’s a mix of classic Swiss sights and lesser-known landscapes.
