  "text": "and use regular trains instead. Get on in St. Moritz and transfer in Reichenau-Tamins, Disentis/Mustér, Andermatt and Visp. You’d be surprised, but even though you’ll be changing trains all the time, it’ll only take you around 20 minutes longer to reach your destination. To put together your schedule, head to the SBB website . These regular trains travel the exact same route as the Glacier Express does. The only thing you’ll be missing out on are the panorama windows and the fancy lunch options or the luxurious seats. Other than that, it's practically the same. In addition to saving you the reservation fee, this option also l ets you travel more flexibly because trains run a lot more frequently. Getting off along the way : I don't recommend interrupting your Glacier Express journey as you need a reservation for this trip. However, if you really want to stop over, make sure you arrange your reservations accordingly. Or, book a multi-day package to take your time to explore the whole route. If you opt for the penny-pincher version, you can get off along the way as often and as long as you please. Book your Glacier Express Package Glacier Express Tickets"
