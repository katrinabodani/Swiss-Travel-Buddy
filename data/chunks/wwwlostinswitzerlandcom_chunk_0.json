As important as this question is, it isn't one that can be answered in a few minutes. Since these requests kept piling up, I decided to take action and to put together a series of ebooks that have one goal: To tell you what is possible to see in Switzerland in X amount of days. The result is a collection of 8 ebooks with a total of 105 itineraries. If this is something you're interested in, visit my itinerary page ."
