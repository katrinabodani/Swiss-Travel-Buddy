  "text": "fiasco in a day after Emirates. Travelling is indeed an experience! B&B Hotel, Zurich By 21:45 hrs, panic mode was in full swing as we desperately tried to summon an Uber, only to face the dreaded “long wait” message. Just when all seemed lost, like a beacon of hope, a local taxi with an Afghan driver appeared out of the Zurich night. He gave us a fair deal, and we hopped on to his taxi. It was my second ride with an Afghan driver (the first time was in the US), and it hit me—India-Afghanistan camaraderie isn’t just about cricket; it travels well beyond borders. Finally, we reached the hotel at around 22.00 hrs. We were not hungry, so we ditched the dinner, though my son had a subway. I was surprised to see that it was priced at CHF 16.50, approx. Rs 1570. “Damn! Switzerland, you pricey little devil,” I couldn’t help but blurt out. But I knew if I kept converting every expense into rupees, I’d end up crying into my Swiss chocolate. So, I ditched the mental math and geared up for the next eight days of Swiss experience. Gotta keep the wallet—and the spirits—upbeat! Day 2"
