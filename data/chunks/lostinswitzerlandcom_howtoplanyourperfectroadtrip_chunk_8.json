What to pack Swiss weather can change quickly, especially in the mountains, so packing layers is a must. Even in summer, it can be chilly at night or during early morning drives through alpine passes. Make sure you bring a light jacket, comfortable walking shoes and at least one warmer layer. You also never know when and where your car might break down and you have to spend some time in the cold. A warm jacket will go a long way in such a case. It’s also worth downloading offline maps or a GPS app, in case you end up in areas with spotty signal. Don’t forget essentials like your driver’s license, passport, travel insurance documents, sunglasses and charging cables. Having some snacks and a refillable water bottle in the car can also make a big difference on longer drives. Prepare for any weather when you're driving through Switzerland. Download an offline map in case your car doesn't come equipped with a GPS. Bonus tips for a smooth road trip"
