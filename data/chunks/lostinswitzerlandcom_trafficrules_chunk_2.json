  "text": "traffic signs, it can be easy to get confused. Understanding these essential signs will help you navigate safely and ensure you follow local driving regulations. As a general rule of thumb, you can remember the following: Blue circular signs tell you to do something Red circular signs tell you not to do something Blue circular signs indicate mandatory directions, such as turn left or right Red circle with a white centre means \"no entry for vehicles\" Red circle with some vehicles in the centre means \"no entry for cars and motorbikes\" Yellow diamond indicates priority road; vehicles on this road have the right of way Triangle with red border indicates that you need to give way to others Green signs indicate motorways, while blue signs indicate main roads Speed limit signs are clearly marked with a red circle and the speed limit inside Red-bordered circle with black arrow crossed by a red slash indicates turns in that direction are prohibited One way street: Blue arrow indicates a mandatory one-way direction One way street: Red circle with a white horizontal bar means no entry in that direction Blue circle with red border and a single red slash means parking is prohibited"
