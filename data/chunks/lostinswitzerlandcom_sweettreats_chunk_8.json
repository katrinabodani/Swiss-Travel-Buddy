Vogelnestli “Vogelnestli” are a great snack if you’re looking for an alternative to chocolate. 13. Spitzbuebe What is it? The more I write, the more I start to question my language. Spitzbueb means “cheeky boy”. It consists of two pieces of short pastry stuck together with jam. The top part traditionally has one or more holes in it, picturing a boy’s face.

You can buy Spitzbuebe either at the bakery or at the supermarket. “Spitzbuebe” aren’t just popular around Christmas. Even though that’s when people usually make them at home. 14. Schümli What is it? Since there’s no official translation for Schümli, I’m going to name them “foamies”. They’re small pieces of chocolate meringue and don’t make for a full dessert on their own. But they’re a great addition to chocolate mousse, a fruit salad or anything that has a splash of whipped cream on it. Where can you buy it? You can buy"
