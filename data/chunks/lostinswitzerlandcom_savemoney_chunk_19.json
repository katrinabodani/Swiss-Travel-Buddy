Close to 60 elderly horses, ponies and donkeys have found their retirement home here and can be visited all year round. If heading all the way to Les Breuleux to check out some horses seems a bit out of scale for you, you can always combine the visit with a hike in the Jura mountain range. Trails can be found and planned through Schweizmobil. 5.4 Observe the storks in Switzerland's largest stork station The stork station in Altreu was brought to life in 1950 when storks in Switzerland were almost extinct. Max Bloesch, a committed sports teacher, worked on bringing the storks back to Switzerland and eventually, his endeavours paid off. Today, over 40 breeding pairs enjoy their summers soaring through the air, strutting across the fields and clattering on the rooftops in Altreu. If you're in the Solothurn area, don't miss out on a couple of relaxing hours in this charming spot next to the River Aare. Altreu is a beautiful place"
