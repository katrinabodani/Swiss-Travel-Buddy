So, I ditched the mental math and geared up for the next eight days of Swiss experience. Gotta keep the wallet—and the spirits—upbeat! Day 2 (12-Jun-2024) – Rhine Falls, Schaffhausen & Engelberg I had a night that felt like a wrestling match with insomnia, tossing and turning until the wee hours. Around 6 a.m., I surrendered to the fact that sleep wasn’t happening—thanks to a front-facing hotel room overlooking the parking lot! Those car headlights played tag with my eyelids all night, turning my sleep into a game of hide-and-seek. We rolled out of bed and were raring to go by 8:00 AM, hungry for breakfast. The B&B served up the standard english morning spread—nothing to write extensively about, but it did the job. After fueling up our tummies, we bid adieu to our room and dropped our bags at reception. Rhine Falls, Switzerland Next stop? The Rumlang train station. Picture us strutting down the street like we own it, ready to catch a train to Neuhausen Rhine Falls station—only a breezy 45 minutes away."
