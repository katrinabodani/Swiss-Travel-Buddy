Bernina Express They say the most spectacular way to cross the Alps is on board the Bernina Express . And \"they\" might just be right.

Between Chur and St. Moritz, the Bernina Express covers the exact same route as the Glacier Express. After St. Moritz, it starts climbing up to glistening glaciers before heading down to the palms of Italy. It passes through 55 tunnels and crosses 196 bridges along the way. The train ends in the Italian city of Tirano. From there, the Bernina Express Bus takes passengers through the famous Valtellina wine region past Lake Como and back into Switzerland. 4 hours 13 minutes (train from Chur to Tirano) or 2 hours 35 minutes (train from St. Moritz to Tirano) and 3 hours 10 minutes (bus from Tirano to Lugano) 156 kilometres (97 miles) on the train, 90 kilometres ( 56 miles) on the bus The Bernina Express runs from May through November between St. Moritz and Tirano.
