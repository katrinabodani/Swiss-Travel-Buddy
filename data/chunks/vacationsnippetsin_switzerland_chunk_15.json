I snapped away like a paparazzo on a mission and quickly realized I had already taken over 150 pics. It was just like the gondola ride to summit in Gulmarg, Kashmir , but tad bit cleaner and with fewer people. An icy paradise, captured from every angle! Titlis Rotair cable car VIDEO Mount Titlis Titlis Cliff Walk One of the coolest things, aside from the jaw-dropping views, was all the fun activities that kept us engaged.First one, the Titlis Cliff Walk—a short jaunt across a secured suspension bridge that dangled us over a 500-meter-deep glacier gorge. As we strolled from the top station to the bridge’s end, we experienced 100 meters of pure adrenaline. The bridge swayed just enough to keep things interesting, making it an exhilarating walk. A thrill ride! Just a friendly tip: Keep small items like keys and selfie stick remotes securely in your pockets. If they fall, say goodbye forever!
