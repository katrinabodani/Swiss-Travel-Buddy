The Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen are Europe's largest waterfalls. 4.3 Wander through the Lavaux vineyards The Lavaux vineyards are the perfect place for wine and/or nature lovers . Stretching all the way from Lausanne to Montreux, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of my favourite spots in western Switzerland. And completely free to access if you don't stop for a glass of wine along the way. Not only is it super peaceful to get lost in those little pathways winding through the vineyards, the spectacular views over Lake Geneva and into the Swiss and French Alps are also unparallelled. The easiest way to reach the vineyards is by local train from either Montreux or Lausanne. Get off in Epesses, Villette or anywhere else along the way and make your way uphill. Or follow the directions on this website . The Lavaux vineyards by Lake Geneva are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's the perfect place to take a stroll through the vineyards and go on a boat ride on"
