It’s cool, dramatic and an easy adventure for all ages. 8. Relax at a spa After a long hike or a day on the slopes, Zermatt’s hotels and wellness centres offer high-quality spa facilities. Think saunas, steam rooms and hot stone massages with mountain views. Some spas allow non-guests to book day access. 9. Try paragliding Tandem paragliding flights are available year-round and take off from various peaks like Rothorn and Gornergrat. Flying past the Matterhorn is a surreal experience and a great way to get a new perspective on the region. 10. Ski or snowboard – even in summer Zermatt’s ski area is one of the highest in the Alps and offers year-round skiing on the Theodul Glacier. In winter, the resort connects with Cervinia in Italy for an international ski experience. Heliskiing is also possible for experienced riders looking for untouched powder. 11. Take a helicopter tour For something unforgettable, book a helicopter flight over the Matterhorn and the surrounding 4000-metre peaks. It’s expensive but provides some of the most stunning alpine views you’ll ever see. 12. Visit"
