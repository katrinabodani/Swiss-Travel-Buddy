  "text": "Guys, I'm in damn Switzerland. Welcome to the most expensive country in the world. Definitely a pinch me moment for both Jan and I. This is the picture you see everywhere on social media. I feel like I'm in a painting. Like I've been transported into a painting. Pinch me right now. I'm dreaming. This is all we can afford. Now that's a souvenir right there. There's nowhere else like Switzerland. Yeah, 100%. Switzerland has some of the greenest grass I've ever seen. [Music] So, we are entering Switzerland now. The border is right here behind me. To be honest, I'm not really sure what they need from us. We do have Canadian passport, so we don't need a visa. Let's go. [Music] So, we just passed through the border. They didn't even ask for anything. We just passed through and we're good to go. So, on this trip, we're actually going to be exploring the Valley of La Brennan and the Valley of Grindlewald in Switzerland. So stay tuned. It's going to be a fun one, guys. All right, so we still have 3 hours till we get to our Airbnb in La Brennan. So we're going to gas"
