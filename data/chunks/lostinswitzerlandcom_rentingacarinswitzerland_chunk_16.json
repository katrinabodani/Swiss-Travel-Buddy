  "text": "vignette costs CHF 40 and is valid for the calendar year. Actually it covers December of the previous year through January of the next. The good news is all Swiss rental cars should already have a valid vignette on the windshield, since it’s required. It’s worth double-checking when you pick up your car, though. Look for a small sticker on the windshield, usually near the rear-view mirror or corner. It shows the last two digits of the current year. So 25 at the point of writing this article. You need a Swiss Vignette to drive on Swiss highways. They cost 40 CHF but Swiss rental cars usually alredy have one. If by some chance your rental car doesn’t have one, you can buy one at gas stations, post offices or border crossings. Driving on a highway without a vignette will result in a hefty fine if you get caught. Once you have the vignette, you can use all the highways with no extra charges , except for a couple of very specific tunnels (like the Great St. Bernard Tunnel to Italy) which have separate tolls. But for most travellers sticking to Swiss roads, there’s nothing else to pay beyond that"
