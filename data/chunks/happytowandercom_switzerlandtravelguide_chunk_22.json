The Swiss Alps offer some of the most picturesque experiences for winter sports enthusiasts in the world, with a vast network of ski resorts and reliable snow conditions… along with high prices to match! Eye-gougingly high price tags aside, Switzerland boasts a wide range of world-class ski resorts catering to all levels of skiers and snowboarders, from beginners to experts. Popular resorts include Zermatt, Verbier, St. Moritz, Davos-Klosters, and the Jungfrau Region.
