You sometimes don't notice how worn out you are until you sit down to catch your breath. Special tip from my mum: If you need to urinate every now and again, it means your body is still hydrated. ðŸ™‚ Thanks for that, mum. Youâ€™re probably laughing right now, but yes, cows can be a danger. Especially if you unintentionally end up between a mother and her calf. As a general rule of thumb, whenever you have to cross a field with cows in it, keep your distance. Donâ€™t approach them, donâ€™t chase them and donâ€™t try to touch them. Just walk by and leave them in peace. Most of the time, they donâ€™t care too much about you anyway. Cows are usually super chill. But get between them and their young and you'll get to know their bad side. Switzerland isnâ€™t exactly the country where you run into something thatâ€™s out to eat you. But we still get the occasional wolf or bear roaming the Alps."
