While chocolate is a major player in our dessert culture, there are tons of alternatives. In the unlikely event of a chocolate overdose, you can turn to this list of 22 iconic Swiss snacks, desserts, comfort foods and general treats if you ever need to mix things up a little. 1. Magenbrot What is it? Literally translated, Magenbrot means “stomach bread” . It’s an awkward looking pastry which, apart from cacao, contains different stomach friendly spices. Hence the creative name. But you know what they say. Don’t judge a book by its cover. 🙂 Where can you buy it? While you can buy Magenbrot at the supermarket , it’s more common to get it out in the street . Every village and every city has a festival, fair or market of some sort every now and then. That’s where the Swiss usually buy those oddly shaped pieces of goodness in their flashy pink bags. Head to the fair to buy yourself a bag of Magenbrot. 2. Gebrannte Mandeln What is it? Like Magenbrot, gebrannte Mandeln are typical for fairs"
