[Music] So, since we got here quite late, it's already like 7:00 p.m., we're actually just going to call it a night and explore LO Brennan tomorrow. Good night. We'll see you guys in the morning. Good morning. First full day here in beautiful Ler Brennan Valley, the valley of the waterfalls. Literally, everywhere you look, there's a waterfall. So, today we're actually just going to walk around lots of Brennan uh and enjoy this valley. And later on, we're going to go on a gondola to the village of Mirin. But first, we'll start it off here, walk around and experience our first full day here in Switzerland. [Music] This behind me right here is the famous low white church and right beside it is the tallest waterfall here in La Brennan. one of the tallest waterfall in Europe which stands 300 m tall and it is just so stunning cuz this is the picture you see everywhere on social media and to be standing here right now it's pretty crazy.
