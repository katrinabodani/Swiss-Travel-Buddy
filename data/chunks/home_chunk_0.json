If there’s one country in Europe I’d single out for being an irritating overachiever, without a doubt, I’d have to say it’s Switzerland. This landlocked country in Central Europe may be small in size, but within its idyllic borders you’ll find everything from elegant cities and luxurious hotels to charming mountain towns surrounded by some of the most dramatic nature on the continent. Shimmering lakes? They have over 1500. Soaring mountain peaks? The country has over 10,000 (named) options. Add in their ridiculously good chocolate and astoundingly good public transport, and you have a dream getaway destination… so long as you can overlook the eye-watering prices. So, today, after many years frolicking through its photogenic wonders, I’m condensing all my Swiss knowledge into this concise Switzerland travel guide filled with all my top tips, itineraries, and recommendations. I hope you find it helpful! Save this Switzerland Travel Guide for Later! You’ll be very glad you"
