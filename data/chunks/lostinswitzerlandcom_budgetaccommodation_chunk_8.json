If you're not familiar with the concept of Couchsurfing, here's how it works: Head to Couchsurfing.com and register your account. Choose \"find host” and enter the city you’re travelling to. If know, select your travel dates or just leave this one open. Set the filter to Accepting Guests and Maybe Accepting Guests . If you’re happy just having coffee with someone, select Wants To Meet Up as well. If you prefer staying with a female / male , set the filter accordingly. Another filter I always set is the “Last Active” one. If someone hasn’t been online in over a year, I usually don’t bother contacting them. Before getting in touch with someone, I also check their response rate . If they have a response rate of 28%, I know there’s a good chance they might not answer. This doesn’t keep me from sending them a request. But I’ll contact different hosts to increase my chances of finding a host. Couchsurfing isn’t simply about finding a free place to stay. It’s also about interacting with people and making friends. To increase your chances of getting accepted,"
