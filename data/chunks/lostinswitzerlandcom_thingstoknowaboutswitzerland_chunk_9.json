You can drink from almost any tap or fountain unless marked otherwise. Skip bottled water. It’s expensive and unnecessary. Just carry your own bottle and refill it as you go. Fill your water bottle along the way... All year round 15. Sunday closures Most shops and supermarkets are closed on Sundays, except at train stations and airports. Plan ahead if you need groceries or shopping time. 16. Grocery stores close early Outside of major cities, supermarkets often close by 7 or 8 PM. Plan your shopping accordingly. 17. No tipping culture Service charges are included in restaurant bills, so tipping is not expected like it is for example in the US or in Canada. However, rounding up to the nearest franc or leaving some change is appreciated for good service. 18. Hiking is a national pastime With well-marked trails across the country, hiking is one of the best ways to experience Switzerland’s stunning landscapes. Even beginners will find plenty of easy, scenic routes. Switzerland is a paradise for hikers, with over 65,000 kilometers of well-maintained and clearly marked trails"
