This city, which I call my home, has a lot to offer. Places like the UNESCO listed Abbey District, the recreational area of Drei Weieren and the free wildlife park of Peter & Paul make it easy to spend a few hours in this city. Head over to a more detailed guide of things to do in St. Gallen . The cathedral in St. Gallen is probably the most photographed building in the city. The recreational are of Drei Weiern Appenzell & Toggenburg After leaving St. Gallen, the Voralpen Express meanders its way through the picturesque areas of Appenzell and Toggenburg. The Toggenburg is nestled between two towering mountain ranges - the Alpstein and the Churfirsten. This part of Switzerland is incredibly pretty and might make you feel like you’ve stepped into a fairy tale. At least that’s how my Australian friend described it when I took her on the Voralpen Express. You’ll pass by green, rolling hills"
