His former lakeside home is now a museum dedicated to his life and work, complete with original furnishings and instruments. 9. Go shopping in the Old Town From Swiss watches and chocolate to local crafts and design shops, Lucerneâ€™s shopping scene is compact but varied. The pedestrianised streets make it easy to browse at your own pace. Schwanenplatz is especially popular if you're looking for a watch. You might want to bring your big wallet for that, though... Those watches don't come cheap! 10. Catch a conterct at the KKL The Culture and Convention Centre Lucerne is known for its world-class acoustics and striking architecture by Jean Nouvel. It hosts the Lucerne Festival and many other concerts throughout the year. 11.
