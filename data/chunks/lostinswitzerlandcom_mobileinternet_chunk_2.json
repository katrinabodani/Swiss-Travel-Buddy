  "text": "Only a few international trains heading to countries like Germany or Italy have onboard internet. If you plan to travel around the country by train , bus or car , having your own mobile data connection is much more reliable. You can access free wifi at all major SBB train stations However, there's no wifi on Swiss trains. Mobile networks in Switzerland Switzerland has three main mobile network operators : Swisscom , Sunrise and Salt . These companies operate the infrastructure that all other mobile providers rely on. Any SIM, eSIM or pocket WiFi plan you buy will use one of these networks. Swisscom generally offers the widest coverage , especially in remote mountain areas. Sunrise also provides strong national coverage and performs well in urban and suburban regions. Salt tends to offer more affordable plans and is well suited for cities, though rural coverage can be patchier compared to the others. Most third-party providers like Digital Republic, Mucho Mobile or Textr do not build their own network. Instead, they “rent” access from one of these main operators. So even if you're buying from a smaller brand, the actual connection quality will still depend on which network they use ."
