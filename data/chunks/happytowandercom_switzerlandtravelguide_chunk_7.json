Why visit Gelmersee when you travel Switzerland: Stunning waters to enjoy as you relax or hike Ride on one of the steepest funicular railways in Europe Great spot for seeing European wildlife Thun And if you’re looking for a destination that’s slightly more offbeat but still outrageously beautiful, then head to Thun (a happy discovery on my last road trip around Switzerland). Thun is a charming town located in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland, nestled along the northern shores of Lake Thun. While small, the city offers a delightful blend of cultural attractions, outdoor activities, and scenic beauty, with a few surprises along the way like river surfers! One of the main attractions is Thun Castle; a medieval fortress that dates back to the 12th century and dominates the skyline of the Old Town, but the Altstadt is also full of other well-preserved medieval buildings, charming cafes, and boutique shops. Thun Panorama, one of the world’s largest circular paintings, can also be found here, but honestly I just found it so nice to walk around and gawk at all the beautiful squares, bridges, and buildings. Well worth a stop if you’re in the area!"
