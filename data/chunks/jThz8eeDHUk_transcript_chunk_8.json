The best thong about these treks is that they are free of cost So, if you want to roam around in Switzerland, you need not spent a huge amount of money except for the fares of the trains to reach here In the rest of the cases, if you book a tour or go to a huge tourist attraction where you need to book tickets then it might cost more. But, this is the best way to enjoy Switzerland You will come across a number of trekking tracks on every station and near every city We are now heading back to Lauterbrunnen Its a bit nippy now- I'll have to wear a jacket Can you guess what the time is, though? It is 8 in the evening And look at how"
