  "text": "commonly used in Switzerland You don't even need an internet connection to use it TWINT TWINT is Switzerlandâ€™s most popular mobile payment app , linked to Swiss bank accounts. Itâ€™s widely used by locals and accepted in many places, including restaurants, supermarkets and public transport. The app also allows users to send money to friends instantly, which is particularly useful for splitting bills. TWINT payments work by scanning QR codes or using Bluetooth technology at supported payment terminals. However, TWINT requires both a Swiss bank account and a Swiss phone number , making it inaccessible to most tourists. As a visitor, you wonâ€™t be able to use TWINT , but you will see it in use everywhere in Switzerland, as it is a preferred method of payment for many residents. So in case you're wondering what this weird word means you read everywhere, now you know... ðŸ˜‰ As you can see, Switzerland offers a wide range of payment options, from traditional cash to digital wallets. What I recommend is using a mix of cash and a credit or debit card. This way, you're always prepared if one means of payment isn't accepted. Before travelling, check with your bank about fees"
