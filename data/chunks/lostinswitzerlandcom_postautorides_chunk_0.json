They make up a huge part of the Swiss public transport system and are famous for reaching every last corner of the country. There's no village too remote, no gorge too narrow and no street too steep for them. To put into perspective just how big Postauto is, let's take a closer look at some numbers. As I explained in my scenic train rides post, the Swiss are big on trains. Our railway tracks add up to roughly 5.200 km, which equals the distance from Ushuaia to SÃ£o Paulo or from Cairns to Sydney and back. Postauto is even bigger. 18.322 km in length to be precise. That's almost half the world's circumference. All crammed into a country that makes up only 0.08% of the world's surface. You get the picture. There are a lot of Postautos roaming our streets. While they can be seen in cities, they're more frequent in rural areas and mountain villages. Which comes with a nice side effect: Lots of Postauto"
