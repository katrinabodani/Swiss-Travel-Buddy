  "text": "Most Swiss cities are built near water. Zurich , Bern, Lucerne, Lausanne, Geneva, Locarno, Zug , Basel , Solothurn … You name it. This is why people often hold the fact that St. Gallen doesn’t have access to a river or a lake against the city. But everyone who makes this claim clearly hasn’t been to Drei Weieren yet. This idyllic spot right above the city is St. Gallen’s secret weapon in terms of water access and great views. Granted. It's not Lake Constance or the River Rhine. But it certainly packs its charm. Drei Weieren, which literally translates to t hree ponds , is a recreational area with five artificial ponds. And yes, we actually do know how to count. Originally, when Drei Weieren were created, they consisted of only three ponds. These served as water reserves to help in case of a city fire and to secure the textile industry’s water supply. The additional two ponds weren’t established until later, when the name was already set. Out of these five ponds, only two are suitable for swimming. The Mannenweier (men’s pond) in the west is the largest one and free to use. It comes with lockers, changing rooms,"
