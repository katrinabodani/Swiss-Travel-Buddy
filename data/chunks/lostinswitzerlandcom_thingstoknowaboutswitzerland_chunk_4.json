While you can drive for hours and hours in bigger countries like Australia, Chile, Canada or the US without the landscape changing much at all, this won't happen to you in Switzerland. You can drive across the country more than once in a day if you wish - St. Gallen to Geneva takes around four hours - but you will encounter all sorts of landscapes and cultures. Even different languages, as you now know. Let me give you an example. The Italian-speaking Ticino region feels Mediterranean, with palm-lined lakes, colorful villages and an Italian flair in food and architecture. In contrast, Zurich is a modern financial hub with a thriving arts scene and vibrant nightlife. The vineyards near Lake Geneva offer scenic countryside views and world-class wine, while the Swiss Alps provide some amazing scenery. No matter where you go, each region has its own charm and unique identity, making Switzerland feel like several countries in one. You can visit the vineyards of Lavaux by Lake Geneva... ... and the city of St. Gallen in Eastern Switzerland in one day. 7. Efficient public transport Switzerlandâ€™s public transport system is one of the best in the world."
