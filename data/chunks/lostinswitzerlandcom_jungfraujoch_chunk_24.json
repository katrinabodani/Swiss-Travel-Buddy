But in the case of Jungfraujoch, I can confidently say that I’d be very surprised if it made your regret-list. In other words. Yes. It is worth it. Even if mountains, glaciers and snow aren’t new to you. There’s just something about this place that’s unlike anything else. I hope you’ll feel the same way.
