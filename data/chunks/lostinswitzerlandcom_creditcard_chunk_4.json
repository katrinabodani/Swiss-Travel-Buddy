Mobile payments: Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay work seamlessly with many Swiss businesses. Prepaid travel cards: Cards like Swiss Bankers Travel Card let you preload CHF and avoid foreign transaction fees, making them a convenient and secure option for travellers. Cash: Although not always necessary, carrying a small amount of Swiss francs can be useful for small vendors and remote areas. If you're used to paying with credit card in your daily life, you will like using them during your trip to Switzerland as well. They offer a secure and hassle-free way to pay for your trip. I recommend combining it with other payment options for a seamless financial experience."
