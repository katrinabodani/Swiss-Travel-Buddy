On Agrotourismus , you'll find over 300 farms providing accommodation in their stables or homes. Offers include everything from a pillow on a bale of straw to a whole apartment. The most budget friendly way to stay on a farm is definitely the sleeping on straw option. Some places offer bedding or extra blankets, but some require you to bring your own sleeping bag to get cozy on your bale of straw. Prices range between 20 and 45 CHF per person with breakfast (usually) included. Depending on where you are, this works out slightly cheaper than staying at a hostel. And the views you sometimes get on these farms are definitely worth taking a little detour out of the city. Sleeping on straw is the perfect place to spend a budget-friendly night out of the ordinary. (This photo is a courtesy of Eselhof SÃ¤ge .) 4.
