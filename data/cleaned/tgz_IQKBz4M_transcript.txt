[Music] So, we just checked into our accommodation in Interlarken. It's this cute little sort of loft space pretty much right in the town center. So, we are going to drop our bags, run out, grab some lunch. We're both so hungry. It is also so hot. So, I've changed into some shorts and sandals. Going to just explore into Larkin this afternoon. Hopefully, maybe go for a swim somewhere, do some painting, just relax. And then tomorrow, we'll head out more and explore. So, let's go get some food. [Music] [Music] We had a little look around the shops and we grabbed grab some lunch from the most amazing little like Asian fusion place in the city and we thought it's such a hot day so we have hopped on the bus. We've come to the swimming steps. This is recommended to us by the guy who owns the Asian Fusion restaurant. So that is where we are. It is about 6:30 in the evening nearly 7:00 and he recommended watching the sunset over the lake. So that's what we're going to do. We've got our books. We've got our paints. We're just going to hang out for a couple of hours at the lake, go for a swim, cool off, and watch the sunset. [Music] [Music] [Music] Thank you so much. [Music] [Music] How old was that? [Music] [Music] [Music] fire. [Music] Wow. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] So, as expected, it is now bucketing down. So, we're leaving the world. We were midway through a mini golf game and we could just see the storm coming up and over the mountains and whilst it was so cool to look at. It was really kind of eerie and ominous. We're like, we better get back into the car before we get caught in the middle of this storm. So, I think we're just going to head home, maybe do tomorrow because of the weather. And then have just like a nice chill afternoon at home, read a book, do some painting, just get nice and cozy while we listen to the scorns. [Music] This was such a cool experience. It's like a hike and it takes you to all these waterfalls within the mountain. It was just absolutely incredible. Honestly, the footage that we got and it just does not do justice to how beautiful and just amazing nature is. Um, yeah, absolutely incredible experience. Would highly recommend. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning from Candace Stag. I have just been sitting on the deck reading my book and drinking my tea and just watching the sun slowly light up the mountains. It's just been absolutely gorgeous. The view is just breathtaking. I've never seen anything quite like this. I wish I could wake up like this every morning. We are heading up the mountain today. We're going to catch the cable car up and then go for a hike around the lake and then swim in the lake and then I'm not too sure how we'll spend the afternoon. Hopefully, we'll go watch the sunset somewhere. The We arrived last night. We're only here for three nights. The accommodation is absolutely beautiful. The attention to detail is just gorgeous. It's so quaint. There's just so many beautiful little details. I absolutely love it. I wish we were staying here longer, but we just really have to make the most of the next two days. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Just starting our hike. It's about an 8.5 km round trip, so it should take us about 3 and 1 half hours. And then we'll finish off at the lake where we can go for a swim. I'm so excited. It's the most beautiful day. It's going to be a well rewarded swim. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Okay, I'm coming. [Music] Just had the most beautiful afternoon and evening just painting in my journal and reading my book. I even had a very quick little nap. We're just about to go out for a little sunset walk. We were going to go out and find a location for sunset, but I think we're just going to stick around Cand instead. It's just been such a beautiful day. We just hiked, we swam, we had the rowboat. It's just a day spent in nature is day well spent. It's just so good for the soul. It's just been so beautiful. And then just sitting here on the deck this afternoon with this just incredible view. It's just been the most perfect day. [Music] Christmas. [Music] We had such a beautiful morning out at Blair Sea. It was so gorgeous. We just kind of sat by the lake, had a little picnic, read our books, played some card games. We are home now. We've just been resting for a little bit, and we've decided, seeing as it's our last day, it's beautiful weather, we're going to go for another hike. We're actually going to hike back up to the lake that we were at yesterday. Instead of catching with her car, we're going to do the hike. I think it should take about an hour and a half. And so, we should get there for around 5:00, go for a swim, hang out for a little bit, and then come back down the mountain and make some dinner before bed. Then, we're off to Zurich tomorrow for our last day in Switzerland before making our way to Porto. [Music] That's where we're going. All the way up there. Not sure if you can see those people. They look like little ants. Long way up. We made it to the lake. only took us about an hour from leaving our accommodation to the lake. So, let's go for a well-deserved swim. It's been such a beautiful afternoon. The water is absolutely gorgeous. So refreshing after a hike up the mountain. So, I think it's time to head back down the mountain, spend our last night in Cander, make some dinner, maybe do some painting, pack our bags, maybe watch the sunset. I think I will end this vlog here because there's nothing too exciting happening tomorrow. We're just driving to Zurich, spending the evening in Zurich, and then boarding our flight the next day to go down to Porto. So, I will see you guys in Porto.
