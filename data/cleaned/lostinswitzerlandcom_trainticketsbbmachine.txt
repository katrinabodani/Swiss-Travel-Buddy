Have you ever found yourself standing in front of a ticket machine and decided that flying an airplane would be easier? I have. And it wasnâ€™t pretty. Iâ€™ve also witnessed my share of confused travellers whoâ€™d just arrived at Zurich Airport and tried to buy their ticket. That wasnâ€™t necessarily pretty, either. To spare you that same dilemma when youâ€™re in Switzerland, I've put together a quick step-by-step guide on how you can buy your Long Distance Ticket without any sweat and tears. Since SBB are now starting to swap out their old ticket machines for new ones, I've made a guide with both machine types. As you can see, using a ticket machine takes quite a few steps. Fortunately, it's quite intuitive and if you know what you want, you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. I hope this has been helpful.
