Lakes aren't too abundant in this area, which makes Étang de la Gruère a perfect habitat for animals relying on open waters. Like for instance dragonflies, butterflies and certain bugs. Walking around the lake takes one hour and should give you plenty of opportunities to spot some wildlife. Or get stung by a mosquito or two... This circular path can get very busy , though. Especially on a sunny weekend. If you can, I recommend visiting the lake on a weekday. Technically, you can go for a swim here. But be warned. Since we're talking about a moor lake, its water is very brown and the ground soggy. While it does feel interesting to sink your feet into the soft ground of a dark lake, it might not be for everyone. My imagination tends to run wild in situations like these and has me see fish the size of blue whales. All out to get me, of course. Also, people sometimes get injured up here. My dad, for example, got himself a pretty nasty scratch from an unexpected wooden pole sticking out of the ground. Those are hard to spot with the water being so dark so please be cautious when you go in and don't jump into the lake.
