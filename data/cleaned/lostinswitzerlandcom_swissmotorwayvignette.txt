If you’re planning to rent a car and drive on Swiss highways instead of travelling by public transport , you’ll need to be familiar with the Swiss Vignette . This little sticker is something you won't be able to get around... Unlike many other European countries that have toll booths on highways, Switzerland uses a vignette system – a prepaid sticker or digital pass that allows vehicles access to motorways. Here’s everything you need to know about the Swiss Vignette, including what it is, who needs it, how much it costs and where to get it. What is the Swiss Vignette? The Swiss Vignette is a mandatory toll pass that grants access to Switzerland’s motorways (Autobahn). It’s a simple, flat-rate system: once you buy the vignette, you can use all Swiss highways for the entire year, regardless of how many times you drive. As of 2023, Switzerland has introduced a digital vignette in addition to the traditional sticker. This allows drivers to register their vehicle online instead of affixing a physical vignette to the windshield. Both versions are valid for the same period and cost the same, giving drivers a choice of which option they prefer. The vignette is your "ticket" for Swiss highways. It is valid for one year and costs 40 CHF. Who needs the vignette? Anyone driving on Swiss motorways in a vehicle weighing up to 3.5 tons (cars, motorcycles, and small vans) must have a valid vignette . This applies to both Swiss residents and visitors driving rental or private vehicles. If you plan a road trip where you only drive on local roads and avoid the motorways, you don’t need the vignette. However, given Switzerland’s extensive motorway network, it’s highly likely you’ll need one at some point during your trip. How much does the Swiss Vignette cost? The price for the vignette is CHF 40 (about €42 or $45) and it is valid for one calendar year – from December 1 of the previous year to January 31 of the following year . This means if you buy one in January 2025, it will be valid until January 31, 2026. Unlike other countries that offer short-term vignettes (e.g., 10-day or monthly options), Switzerland only provides the annual vignette. Even if you’re only visiting for a few days, you need to purchase the full-year pass. Where to buy the Swiss Vignette You can buy the vignette in both sticker and digital versions at various locations: Sticker Version Gas stations and post offices across Switzerland Border crossings when entering the country Automobile clubs in neighboring countries (such as ADAC in Germany or ÖAMTC in Austria) Digital Vignette Online via the official Swiss government website https://via.admin.ch/ Available immediately upon purchase, with registration linked to your vehicle’s license plate If you opt for the digital vignette, you can buy it though the offcial Swiss admin website (Photo: screenshot via.admin.ch) If you’re renting a car in Switzerland , the rental vehicle should already have a vignette, but it’s always a good idea to double-check with the rental company. How to use the Swiss Vignette For the physical vignette , it must be affixed to the inside of the windshield , ideally in the lower-left or center area near the rearview mirror. If it’s not properly attached (e.g., just placed on the dashboard), it is not considered valid and you risk a fine. For the digital vignette , you must register your vehicle’s license plate online when purchasing it. The system will automatically recognize your registration when driving on Swiss highways. By the way, this is only one of the many Swiss traffic rules you should be aware of when driving in Switzerland. What happens if you don’t have a vignette? Driving on Swiss highways without a valid vignette can result in a hefty fine of CHF 200 , plus you’ll still have to buy a vignette on top of that. Police and highway officials frequently check vehicles, so it’s not worth the risk. Are there any additional toll roads in Switzerland? While the Swiss vignette covers most highways, a few specific tunnels and alpine passes require additional tolls . These toll roads operate separately from the vignette system, meaning you must pay an extra fee when using them. Here are some of the most notable toll roads in Switzerland you might come across during your scenic road trip : Great St. Bernard Tunnel: This tunnel connects Switzerland with Italy and requires a toll. A one-way trip costs around CHF 30–50 , depending on the vehicle type. A round-trip ticket is slightly discounted if purchased together. Munt la Schera Tunnel: This single-lane tunnel connects Switzerland with Livigno, Italy, and operates on a time-controlled alternating traffic system. The toll fee is around CHF 15–20 per vehicle and tickets must be purchased before entry. Lötschberg and Furka car trains: While not technically a toll road, these car-carrying trains allow drivers to bypass long mountain detours by transporting vehicles through tunnels. The Lötschberg car train (between Kandersteg and Goppenstein) costs approximately CHF 27 per trip, while the Furka car train (connecting Realp and Oberwald) has similar pricing. Vereina Tunnel: The Vereina car train provides a convenient shortcut between the Engadin region and the Prättigau valley, significantly reducing travel time compared to driving over mountain passes. The toll fee for a standard car is approximately CHF 35–50 per trip. Reservations are not required, as trains run frequently. Gotthard and San Bernardino Tunnels: These tunnels are covered by the vignette, meaning no additional tolls apply. However, during peak travel times (especially summer weekends), expect heavy traffic and possible long delays. If your route includes any of these tunnels or car trains, it’s a good idea to check current toll rates and operating hours in advance to avoid surprises. You now know everything you need to be prepared for your Swiss road trip. Whether you opt for the traditional sticker or the new digital vignette, make sure you have one before hitting the road to avoid fines and enjoy a smooth driving experience in Switzerland.
