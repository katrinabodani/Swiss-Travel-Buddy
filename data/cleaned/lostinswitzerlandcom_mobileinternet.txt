Staying connected while travelling in Switzerland can be surprisingly tricky if you don’t plan ahead. Whether you want to use your favourite app to navigate the Alps, check train schedules on the go or upload your hike to Instagram, you’ll need mobile internet. Ideally, one that won’t cost you a fortune. Unlike most EU countries, Switzerland is not part of the European Union . This means EU roaming benefits often do not apply . Many travellers are surprised to find that their supposedly “Europe-wide” data plan suddenly stops working or starts charging hefty roaming fees once they cross the Swiss border. This guide breaks down your best options for mobile internet in Switzerland. From eSIMs and local SIM cards to portable WiFi hotspots, I’ve selected six providers that offer solid coverage and pricing. These are suitable whether you're in Switzerland for a weekend getaway or an extended road trip. Find your travel sim card to stay connected in Switzerland There are a number of sim card providers with great data plans The WiFi situation in Switzerland WiFi access is generally easy to find in Switzerland, but it should not be your only plan for staying online. While most hotels and Airbnb apartments offer free WiFi , cafés and restaurants usually require you to ask for a password or log in with your phone number. This can be inconvenient when you only want to quickly check a map or message someone. Public WiFi access is improving. Major SBB train stations and airports such as Zurich, Geneva and Basel provide free WiFi with no registration required. That is a pleasant surprise compared to many European countries, where connecting to public WiFi usually involves entering an email or confirming your phone number. However, SBB trains do not offer WiFi on most domestic routes. Only a few international trains heading to countries like Germany or Italy have onboard internet. If you plan to travel around the country by train , bus or car , having your own mobile data connection is much more reliable. You can access free wifi at all major SBB train stations However, there's no wifi on Swiss trains. Mobile networks in Switzerland Switzerland has three main mobile network operators : Swisscom , Sunrise and Salt . These companies operate the infrastructure that all other mobile providers rely on. Any SIM, eSIM or pocket WiFi plan you buy will use one of these networks. Swisscom generally offers the widest coverage , especially in remote mountain areas. Sunrise also provides strong national coverage and performs well in urban and suburban regions. Salt tends to offer more affordable plans and is well suited for cities, though rural coverage can be patchier compared to the others. Most third-party providers like Digital Republic, Mucho Mobile or Textr do not build their own network. Instead, they “rent” access from one of these main operators. So even if you're buying from a smaller brand, the actual connection quality will still depend on which network they use . eSIM, SIM card or Pocket WiFi? There are three main ways to stay connected in Switzerland: using an eSIM , a physical SIM card or a Pocket WiFi device . The best option depends on your phone compatibility, travel style and whether you plan to share the connection with others. An eSIM is a digital SIM card that you install by scanning a QR code. There is no shipping or waiting involved. If your phone supports eSIM, this is usually the fastest and most convenient option. A physical SIM card is a good alternative if your phone doesn’t support eSIM. These are still widely used in Switzerland and can offer better value, especially if you need calls and texts. You may need to wait for delivery or pick it up locally. A Pocket WiFi device allows you to share internet with multiple devices without replacing your SIM. This is perfect for groups or families but requires you to carry and charge an extra device daily. Digital Republic (eSIM and SIM) Digital Republic is a Swiss-based mobile provider offering flexible, contract-free plans tailored for both short-term visitors and long-term residents. Their services are designed to be straightforward, allowing you to manage your plans through an intuitive online portal.
