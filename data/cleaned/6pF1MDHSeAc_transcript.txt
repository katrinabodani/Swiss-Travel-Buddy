more hour left that's the Vibes I'll see you guys [Laughter] [Music] later yeah if I want that or if I want the one that sound a little bit of a [Music] yesterday look at [Music] this say something [Music] see [Music] get this is where they filmed Crash Landing into you it's like that 1K drama guess it's a little cold I'm not going to lie but it's like at least it's not raining like the sky is blue the ocean is literally blue we just walk in you was some who booked this place for us and you can see it's like quite spacious I was wearing like these platform boots and I switched out of them thank God I bought my sneakers when we landed keute was like you want paragliding and I'm like huh I H think that she's a dog I'm just a cat I'm an indoor cat like to be on ground hi guys we're currently heading out of the hotel it just feels like it's straight out of a green screen guys like look at this so quiet there's nobody here you definitely do see Taurus but it's not too much we are here in March I don't know if it gets warmer there's going to be more people H I just think we're so lucky with this weather currently 36 de but it's not windy the sun is hitting right on you I don't even think I hear birds huh you hear birds no oh I do if I really focus I do currently staying at the Strand Hotel we walked into the restaurant and then we were trying to find reception the lady was like where are you going and we're like we're looking for a reception and she's like that's the toilet babes I think the best trips are usually like the ones where you have absolutely no plan on what to do so we're just going to walk around I know Q wants us to have a plan XYZ location anything you would like to add yeah so I would love to like hit xyc spot but honestly have some therapeutic walk into nature watch some grass and water watch some ducks chilling out there where are the Ducks there they there two of them like us weather is good the sun is out come ask for more yeah let's go let's go look at her look at her running look at her running oh my God guys you have to pay to like go over there even if you don't have coins you can pay it digitally this is like top TI your nature like the sky is blue there's clean Ducks down there there's Mountain there's flowers there's beautiful houses like why do you need a plant you don't need a plant oh my God guys one of the primary reasons I even ever came to switherland the first time is because I wanted to pet the cattles but the first time I was in Zer where can I find that in Zer but guys I think I see animals right now I literally called it Uber to get there because we missed our bus and we're only here for a day so I'm like we cannot waste time and I see donkeys my Uber is literally coming 8 minutes I'm making up this hike they're freaking real oh my God those are real those are real like [ __ ] donkeys that's a sheep that's a ram a goat no that's a donkey no there's a donkey and a goat it has horns what wait is it oh wait wait no you're right never mind I thought it was a sheep it's actually a donkey dude it's like looking at me can't believe this real that one's like not moving inside that is all cows this brown one is significantly smaller than the white one the Ubers here are very expensive I do not recommend calling it unless you're in like a desperate situation because uh in some areas like the hotel that we're at it only comes by hourly anyways seat inside this Uber is so interesting like I don't know if this is like a European thing because I remember in the UK they also has seats like this I'm borrowing Q scarf because my scarf is wool and I'm wearing a black trench and I always have to do use a limp roller and this is cashmere and so it doesn't get on me I have body lotion you want to B you don't want huh what you it started off with like her being like I want Italian food do you want Indian food yeah do you want Japanese food food do you want Chinese food the first time I came here we went to like a Asian Chinese restaurant and it was not good you guys can correct me if I'm wrong I don't know if I trust the Asian food in Europe but the white people food white people food is good yeah the white people food is good all right shall we walk in the city or next to the river where are we right now right now we're like in the city we go to the river call me lazy call me whatever but I do realize that when I travel I tend to not really make plans especially in an area that I'm just not too familiar with every single Street I cross that's a street I've never been on Sky I've never seen before the mountains is also new to me the godum trees are also new to me you see all these trees they're just all in one place and the trunks are freaking thick I just feel these trees like belong in the forest like what do you mean it's like right here and something that I do realize is that in Switzerland like people are very very active like people felt like birds and then here we were just going down into the City and we passed by this really really cute little gift shop I usually like to go to gift shops When I visit uh different countries because I like to kill magnets so here I did buy interlock and magnet and I also was checking out the toy they were a little crazy in price so I was like I'mma put that down and pretend I'd never touched and this toy right here reminded me of childhood I don't remember what the name it made me feel so nostalgic though the sun was setting most of the time we were definitely just like strolling around just depends on what type of traveler you are but the scenery and everything it was beautiful I just loved looking at architecture even when I'm in the states like if I'm in New York or if I'm in Boston I love just going around this is my sounds so creepy but I don't mean it in a creepy way but I love just like house watching like I love like looking at people's houses and just admiring it seeing color they are what type of shapes they are I do realize European houses like the windows are just longer they look like art pieces it was so relaxing to just walk around you just see a house and then far down you just see a mountain you just see glaciers also tip tip tip if you guys come here bring comfortable shoes on my first few days here I was wearing like these platform heel boots and honestly they're not like uncomfortable but nothing can truly be a pair of sneakers I know beauty is pain but sometimes it's not worth it sometimes you just can't enjoy the scenery as much everyone here wear sneakers just very practical shoes afterwards we came into this really cute little store um I didn't really know how to play this instrum but cute was like you have to hit each and one of them separately you just have to Glide the instrument down it's really cute just visit little shops even though I think the owners might find us a little annoying cuz we didn't buy anything it was getting late and if you know q and I when we're together our quality time is eating so today we were craving pizza but we saw this one restaurant okay she looked very bougie but honestly prices wise I think it was very similar to like other food in Switzerland the prices of food here is very comparable to the prices in New York I really wanted a Bata Pizza half of it with no prawns and half of it with prawns because I'm vegetarian and then we order a little salad I was thinking of ordering spaghetti but we were thinking that maybe that's too much I did order some white wine because these days I want to try out different sorts of white wine and find out which one's my favorite and I could never get over the bread here apparently you're supposed to put a little bit of salt into the olive oil and it is a game changer and the pizza was honestly so yummy it was so crisp it wasn't too oily it tastes healthier anyways that's a wrap on dinner and it was very yummy to go back to like the hotel I checked the bus oh my God the last bus is at 8:00 the next bus comes in 10 minutes so if we miss this one it's done my God we have to rush right now and I felt so bad because like I was rushing the waiter to get like the check if you don't give me this check you up I'm not getting [Music] home okay guys we're going to give you a room tour okay so this is our little room that we're only staying for a night but honestly very spacious this is like one small carry-on bag is like where we went out at and this is the heater itself when we just came back we literally had the door open so it's so damn cold inside and it has like a lot of space and I like that they give you a mirror and then there's a TV and there's a desk I've never seen this before one bed but it's two separate and then in here is the bathroom it's pretty nice actually what do they have they have towels and 225 a night oh it's actually pretty expensive it is a touristy area since people come here cuz of the K drama left the door open so like he is [ __ ] blaming me but she didn't remite me [ __ ] okay we were both in this room she was saying that she was in the bathroom but I'm like guys just look at the distance from the bathroom to the door this apparently is a heater and I'm just leaning against it and I think Q is planning on sleeping with her jacket Q lend me like this PJ thing I may just wear it tomorrow productive she said so productive because like when I wake up I'm just going to be ready to go D you you position the phone it's like not going through my Jacko you are so thick right now take it off who made me take off guys she stinks with her really doesn't but she makes such a big deal so pissed why do you mean you haven't borrow my sweat I'm L going to wear what you're not going to wear you feel it I do know how the heck is the heat even coming out this is my pj guys I think about wearing it out but then I tried it on and I it's so cute it's like Mountain Vibes good morning everyone look at this beautiful view I just did my skincare and it's so cold out but this view is crazy w oh it's like pink orange and what blue what it's a little chilly but it's not like super cold but imagine waking up to this in like the spring or the summer it's so pretty bro last night I slept okay let me just give you guys like a brief review of the hotel so far I would say that the bed itself it's pretty damn soft remember how it was like super cold that was our fault afterwards it was very warm the ground of this bathroom is very warm and I like how hot the water gets the sink right here it doesn't drain and you have to manually lift the drain the Wi-Fi not so good Outlets all work fine he will saying that the breakfast is really good so we're going to get breakfast later there's no really any restaurants near us currently it's like 8:00 breakfast starts at 8:30 we're going to probably leave here around like 10:00 cuz we want to catch the 10:30 bus I just finished getting ready and I'm literally taking in this view right now honestly when I woke up in the hotel room I was like there's nothing too special going on this is what we paid for I don't know if you see that there's like a little boat right there you know those water bottles that have like the mount on there that literally just looks like what it is like you see that like that mountain right there it's so pretty I'm sorry if I'm showing you the same frame over and over again I just generally cannot get over this View and [Music] [Music] look [Music] [Music] [Music] off [Music] wait [Music] oh my [Music] God ew don't pet AR you allergic okay all right hello do you have like milk no we don't got milk this is a butcher shop what Ty of me do you want do you have cheese it's a butcher shot oh I want like a rip eye about that yeah you look good in this Frame the butcher with good face cars when I go into stores to buy like the cows I never have to pay cuz I go I just don't want to sell to you yeah I want to buy you though F you bye bye bye bye see you later it's my freedom of to stand here my freedom this is shut down bye oh bye what is this big girl doing she w is that you don't hit your head she's coming out of the Butcher Store oh I told you karma for me not selling you me I saw it [Music] check can you guys guess what we're heading to right now okay so we switched trains multiple times because we had to do some transfers but we are going to Basel let me tell you what is my favorite restaurant of all in Switzerland it's tibits Q was the one who bought me to this place like the first time I came to swi out she bought me to Tippets and I freaking love it for those who don't know it's basic vegetarian Buffet they weigh it by the pound it's not like a buffet where it's like an all you can eat buffet y'all did you guys see that teramis Su right there that sh was busing now she was so good also the top is made out of yogurt I'm pretty sure and they just have so many different desserts I just don't know how they come up with it it's not like boring white people like they season it and some of these actually look like meat dishes K is not vegetarian but she told me how she and her girlfriends will come here so basically at the end they weigh it by the pound and you can also order a drink and with each meal it comes with a piece of bread the total of the two plates right here was 45 Franks later I would get like a second plate of savory food and then I would end with with desserts so I just will not find this in the state so I'm I'mma eat Tippets is like the only place that I would like I will pick out I just eat as much as I can I do not care it looked like when I eat this I will be the happiest person in the world and godamn I was right New York City come on can we make a tibits here too I'm not really picky about food but uh I do have things I do not like it's olives it's just olives all around it doesn't matter which country is in it just tastes like a whole bunch of salt water in my mouth and there was like this one patty thing that literally pulls it looks like mate and it was so yummy anyways now we're going to go cruise around the city guys I've been seeing so many Claire's I don't even see that many Claire's into the states like Claire's is so popular like back in like Middle School Claire's was like a big deal I can't get over the trams here they're actually on ground cuz I'm just so used to like seeing trains going underground so seeing them like being so close to people is actually kind of crazy oh my god did I tell you we're currently in bosil we're heading to downtown and later we're going to go to an art museum apparently they say this is the longest river in Europe so that's pretty interesting all this ground is like Cobblestone um I don't really much of a hike here mentioned that this is a scene that I must see so you better go see it I was like no I don't want to do it shoes I highly recommend this longest river in Europe huh how many countries does it run down five Europe is well connected see these days I still don't know what's considered a pond what's considered a lake what's consider a river ocean a sea you're looking at me but I'm like I don't know how to explain that either anyways okay we're going to hike up that's let's go that's the vibe so right now we're just going to go so the first Sunday of every month museums have free entrance they can like explore all the museums for free and pay like $2 if you're an adult it's free yeah okay this might be the craziest Museum I have ever been to so this museum has like a lot of animals a lot of these sculptures they don't really put a fence around it that just shows you how how much they trust their citizens honestly because imagine this in the state it'll be vandalized like people will ruin it but guys one of my biggest question is are these oh my God come on come on they these are sculptures right they look so real okay are these sculptures or are these real like when am I ever going to get this close to a wolf or when am I ever going to get this close to an otter right but these binocular things were pretty cool it felt like I was like a researcher in the wild looking into animals except that that will never be me okay let's explore the rest of this Museum okay that's via and that's the mega anteron via is like out in the wild I don't know how she's going to survive I can't bike I can't swim she's going to Incline walk what's that this is like a dinosaur no G foro it's a big elephant have you ever like um ride on one no no we should go to tan and do that I watch you do it I'm going to go there to eat mango sticky rice that's via and that's mammo mammo and Via what is that 12 feet no idea it's like this big even like running will not help you're going to squash me like a watermelon eaters I wonder looks like a plk eater what are you I'm probably that one be why they include a human skeleton in there oh maybe they're trying to show size comparison that's a giraffe that's huge [Music] B [Music] [Music] I see how long [Music] [Music] most people are sitting outside nobody's sitting inside I hope you can hear me just like music playing after grocery shopping we're going to head back and I'm going to make c one of my signature plates it's going to be yummy I've actually never tried hamus Switzerland before so I'm excited it's always so crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside like you can just tell what it's made out of and it's so nice usually when I go to certain places food is not the number one thing that comes to my mind that I want to buy can I bring bread into the country it's like so obvious that I'm the Foreigner here maybe just because I'm just Asian nobody is sitting inside I think like one table who's sitting inside everyone's sitting outside because it's like 51° it's honestly the weather where you should be sitting outside but also guys I posted on my Instagram story European men are just a little different okay oh my God I hate to admit this lowy he was cute so I left ASAP and anyways here I did some grocery I consider grocery shopping in other countries like a cultural experience you know even in the states it's like a mall it is retail therapy for me except it's grocery shopping so this clip you can see how I'm dealing with the potatoes first potatoes take a long time to cook in the oven I read online there were like you can just cut the potatoes up and just put it in the air fryer we put her in the air fryer for like 15 minutes something that is very necessary for all my place is the broccolini and the tofu currently I am back in the States I am back in New York the please just do not hit the same with my carrots that I put in the oven in New York they taste really hard but with the ones in Switzerland with the same amount of time it tasted so soft in the states the barata is gooey in Switzerland it had like a pulling texture and guys I found some purple tomatoes and I freaking loved it so we didn't have any like spray oil so uh yeah I was oiling up the um veggies and so because my hands are so oily I asked Q to sprinkle on the salt oats here in Europe they don't soak up all the water and then overnight I would see that the oats is still kind of watering it was the same at the interlockin hotel like I noticed the oats was kind of watery and Q mentioned maybe in the states we put salt so the food is now ready and uh Q is not a fan of the burnt uh broccolini and low key I don't even know if that's good for you because I like my broccolini a little burnt okay and this smoked tofu is so good so we also did buy drinks I bought like some Plum juice because I wanted to try the juicer but um anyways let's dig in M this is so good we tast different too M if these on mustard is so salty tomato here very sweet oh the radishes I'm excited so crunchy it's good right this tastes better than the one you make in the stage yeah the ingredients is just fresh um I apologize if this Vlog ended super abruptly because actually there were 20 minutes of footage left I don't think I can get it done in time for it to be posted tomorrow
