Visit the Glacier Garden Right next to the Lion Monument, the Glacier Garden showcases glacial potholes from the last Ice Age, as well as a mirror maze and geological exhibits.

The 360-degree artwork is housed in a dedicated rotunda and offers a fascinating look at Swiss humanitarian history. 4. Take a stroll along the lake shore Lucerne’s waterfront promenade stretches from the old town all the way to the Swiss Museum of Transport . It’s a beautiful, flat walk with mountain views the whole way. You can also take a boat back to the centre if you don’t feel like walking both directions. 5. Climb the Musegg Wall The Museggmauer is a preserved section of Lucerne’s old city walls, complete with medieval watchtowers. In summer, some of the towers are open to visitors and offer panoramic views over the city and lake. 6.
