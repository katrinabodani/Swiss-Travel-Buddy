Other things to do in Zermatt 1. Explore the village of Zermatt The centre of Zermatt is car-free and perfect for strolling. You’ll find cobbled streets, historic chalets and a good mix of restaurants, cafes and shops. It’s worth taking time to simply wander and enjoy the peaceful setting. Don’t miss the view of the Matterhorn from the Kirchbrücke. 2. Visit the Matterhorn Museum "Zermatlantis" This underground museum tells the story of Zermatt and its evolution from a remote mountain village to a world-class resort. It includes exhibits on mountaineering, local history and the dramatic first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865. The museum is well-curated and a great indoor option for a rainy day. 3. Try local Valais specialities Zermatt is a great place to sample regional dishes like raclette, fondue, rösti and dried meats. Many mountain restaurants serve these traditional meals with unbeatable views. Cheese lovers in particular will be in heaven. 4. Go mountain biking Zermatt has over 100 km of marked bike trails for every level of rider. The Sunnegga and Rothorn areas are especially popular, and the resort continues to expand its bike-friendly infrastructure. Bike rentals and guided tours are widely available. 5. Take the Sunnegga funicular This underground train gets you from the village to the Sunnegga plateau in under five minutes. From here, you can hike, bike, or simply enjoy the views of the Matterhorn. It’s also the start of the Five Lakes Trail. 6. Visit the Ricola Herb Garden Above the village, near the Edelweiss trail, you’ll find a Ricola demonstration garden with 13 herbs used in their iconic sweets. It’s a quiet and fragrant place to pause and learn something new. The garden is free to visit and best enjoyed in summer. 7. Walk through the Gorner Gorge A short walk from the village, this narrow gorge is carved by glacial meltwater and features wooden walkways suspended over rushing turquoise water. It’s cool, dramatic and an easy adventure for all ages. 8. Relax at a spa After a long hike or a day on the slopes, Zermatt’s hotels and wellness centres offer high-quality spa facilities. Think saunas, steam rooms and hot stone massages with mountain views. Some spas allow non-guests to book day access. 9. Try paragliding Tandem paragliding flights are available year-round and take off from various peaks like Rothorn and Gornergrat. Flying past the Matterhorn is a surreal experience and a great way to get a new perspective on the region. 10. Ski or snowboard – even in summer Zermatt’s ski area is one of the highest in the Alps and offers year-round skiing on the Theodul Glacier. In winter, the resort connects with Cervinia in Italy for an international ski experience. Heliskiing is also possible for experienced riders looking for untouched powder. 11. Take a helicopter tour For something unforgettable, book a helicopter flight over the Matterhorn and the surrounding 4000-metre peaks. It’s expensive but provides some of the most stunning alpine views you’ll ever see. 12. Visit Findeln This small hamlet above Zermatt is accessible on foot or via Sunnegga and is known for its panoramic views and traditional alpine restaurants. It’s a perfect lunch stop during a hike, especially in summer when the terraces are open.
