Like Meja sang in her hit back in the 90s: It's all 'bout the money. And isn't that true. In your everyday life as well as during your travels. Since money plays such an important role when you're visiting Switzerland, I'm dedicating this article to explaining all the means of payment you can use during your trip. Cash Despite being a modern economy, Switzerland still has a strong cash culture . The Swiss franc (CHF) is the official currency and some places, particularly in rural areas, may not accept cards. Cash is commonly used in smaller stores, local markets and for tipping, though tipping is not mandatory. Many vending machines, especially those in older locations, also still require coins. If you plan on visiting remote areas or using services like public toilets, carrying some coins and a few bank notes is always a good idea. Swiss banknotes come in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 1,000 francs. The banknotes are colourful and feature different Swiss historical figures and cultural elements. Coins are available in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes (Rappen), as well as 1, 2, and 5 francs. The 5-franc coin is the largest and heaviest. Cash is easy to get in Switzerland. ATMs (known as "Bancomats" in Switzerland) are widely available in cities, towns and even smaller villages. They are the most convenient way to withdraw Swiss francs. Most ATMs accept foreign debit and credit cards, though fees may apply depending on your bank. Some ATMs also offer currency exchange services, but rates might not always be the best. Some larger businesses, including train stations and airports, also have currency exchange offices where you can get Swiss francs, though these may charge higher fees than ATMs. ATMs are abundant in Switzerland. They're especially easy to find near train stations. Debit Cards Most Swiss residents use debit cards for daily transactions and they are widely accepted across the country. You can use them to pay in supermarkets, restaurants and public transport ticket machines. Swiss banks commonly issue Maestro or Visa Debit cards, and these work seamlessly within the country. However, international debit cards may sometimes face limitations, especially if they are not enabled for foreign transactions. Itâ€™s a good idea to check with your bank before travelling to ensure your card will work in Switzerland. If your card is contactless, you can use it for quick tap payments in many places, making transactions even more convenient. Prepaid Travel Cards Prepaid travel money cards allow you to load multiple currencies and use them like a debit or credit card. These are useful for budgeting, as they let you lock in exchange rates before you travel. Some popular travel cards include Revolut, Wise and various bank-issued prepaid options. However, not all businesses in Switzerland accept prepaid cards, particularly in rural areas. While they are generally a good alternative for travellers who want to manage expenses more closely, itâ€™s best to carry an alternative payment method in case a retailer does not accept prepaid cards. Prepaid Travel Cards are super handy when travelling I personally love using Revolut Credit Cards Credit cards are widely accepted in Switzerland, especially Visa and Mastercard . However, American Express and Diners Club may not be as commonly used in smaller shops. Credit cards are particularly useful for hotel bookings, car rentals and larger purchases. Some Swiss businesses, particularly in rural areas, prefer payment by debit card or cash to avoid transaction fees. If you plan to use your credit card frequently, itâ€™s a good idea to check if your provider charges foreign transaction fees . Many businesses accept contactless credit card payments, making it a fast and secure option for everyday purchases. If you'd like more information about this subject, ready my article about the use of credit cards in Switzerland . Apple Pay, Google Pay & Samsung Pay These mobile payment options are becoming more popular and are accepted at many stores, restaurants and public transport kiosks. They work by linking your credit or debit card to your smartphone, allowing for secure contactless payments. Most major Swiss banks support these services and they are ideal for quick and easy payments, especially in urban areas. If your credit or debit card is compatible with these digital wallets, you should be able to use them in most places where contactless payments are accepted, making them a convenient option for travelers who prefer not to carry physical cards. Google, Apple and Samsung Pay are commonly used in Switzerland You don't even need an internet connection to use it TWINT TWINT is Switzerlandâ€™s most popular mobile payment app , linked to Swiss bank accounts. Itâ€™s widely used by locals and accepted in many places, including restaurants, supermarkets and public transport. The app also allows users to send money to friends instantly, which is particularly useful for splitting bills. TWINT payments work by scanning QR codes or using Bluetooth technology at supported payment terminals. However, TWINT requires both a Swiss bank account and a Swiss phone number , making it inaccessible to most tourists. As a visitor, you wonâ€™t be able to use TWINT , but you will see it in use everywhere in Switzerland, as it is a preferred method of payment for many residents. So in case you're wondering what this weird word means you read everywhere, now you know... ðŸ˜‰ As you can see, Switzerland offers a wide range of payment options, from traditional cash to digital wallets. What I recommend is using a mix of cash and a credit or debit card. This way, you're always prepared if one means of payment isn't accepted. Before travelling, check with your bank about fees and international compatibility to ensure smooth transactions during your trip.
