Have you ever counted the apps on your phone? I just did. And the result was not what I expected. I guessed there’d be around 55. Maybe 70. Tops. But reality proved me wrong. There's a whopping 114 apps taking up space on my phone. When on earth did it become necessary to have so many? Of course, quite a few of those apps are tucked away in a folder labelled "Travel". And if you're planning a trip to Switzerland and wondering what travel apps will make your life easier while you're here, you've come to the right place.
