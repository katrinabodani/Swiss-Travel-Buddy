[Music] Switzerland is perfect from having the cleanest water to the most unbelievable Landscapes Switzerland is a real life fairy tale it's constantly at the top of the list for having the country with the highest quality of life but also the top of the list for the most expensive on top of all this Switzerland is a neutral country they don't pick sides in wars and they remain peaceful by any means necessary even if that means they have to blow up a bridge after traveling this magical country for the past week I wanted to share with you all what traveling the most perfect country on the planet is like well hello guys from the wonderful land of Switzerland so for the next week we're going to be traveling around Switzerland and I am so excited the only one thing that I'm not excited about is how expensive this country is the beauty really does come with a price like this rental car right here was the cheapest rental car that they had and it is still $180 per day also we have not slept in over 36 hours now since we flew in from New York City to here to Switzerland and now we are going to be road tripping for the next couple hours all the way down to interlockin where we're going to explore some lakes and some mountains some valleys and do all these adventurous activities that Switzerland has has the offer so starting right now let the adventure begin give me a wo wo wo I can't do here we [Music] goo always like a rocket quick stop and L to get some chocolate Swiss chocolate down uping like chocolate secured going on a Switzerland road trip should be on everyone's bucket list every little town that you drive through just feels like an Enchanted Village we just made a quick stop in this town called Brien and it is just so cool exploring walking around seeing restaurants that are almost older than America oh and also supposedly the most beautiful streets in all of Europe so this Street has been voted the most beautiful Street in all of Europe with every street not only in y but in all [Music] switzerlandswitzerland where I just figure that they photoshopped and Lightroom the water to look more turquoise than it actually was but coming here now to brien's I believe this is even the brien's lake where the water is really that blue confirming the blue ass water and we learned that it is from the snow melting from the glaciers and the minerals from that and on the Rocks just come here to the lake and give it this incredible turquoise blue speaking of Clean Water Switzerland has the cleanest water on the planet where you can just drink from these random fountains around the country it's really good one of the great things about adventuring around Switzerland is that everywhere you go you have these fountains with super fresh water and to make that even better always have to throw in some liquid IV so liquid IV is a must have when going on adventures each packet is bursting with fresh natural flavors and it tastes delicious this new strawberry hydration multiplier is definitely my favorite it has more vitamin C than an orange and as much potassium as a banana helping you stay hydrated and energized in a great tasting way also I highly recommend it as a hangover cure if you want to try liquid i v hydration multiplier you can use my code in the description for 25% off their entire site if you are going on an adventure and need a lot of energy I do highly recommend a liquid IV since it is also super [Music] delicious so far we've learned one thing about Switzerland that house fart means exit going to be fluent in German in no time house fart house fart house [Music] fart good morning guys from the beautiful Interlock in Switzerland after our super long travel day yesterday we made it here at around 10: p.m. and just passed out like a ton of bricks but there's nothing like waking up in a new place and just being Amazed by all the incredible sits especially from your hotel window and before we do get on with our action pack day I did want to show you guys what $300 a night gets you here in Interlock in Switzerland check this out yep that's it so today we are checking off a bucket list item we are heading to the top of Europe it is the highest point in the continent where you have to take a 45-minute tram ride all the way to the top but you do get incredible views like this all the tales we will tell our children and highly recommend if you are doing this grab a lint mocha where it's a cappuccino with a fountain of lint chocolate that they put in it all right well we are officially the highest people in all of Europe Hy do you feel do you feel high I I am super high right now no honestly do you feel the altitude I feel the altitude I guess I'm a little used to it now we've been up here for like 5 minutes but when we first got up here it was like a little woozy like yeah I can definitely feel that that we are pretty high I think right now we are about 11,000 ft so we are able to just Overlook all of the Alps and get these incredible views of the top of the mountains of Switzerland so next up we are heading to the ice palace I believe we go inside of a glacier just into freezing ice cold Rock we definitely did not dress properly for this we are just in a little sweater Hy has this super thin cardigan on and we about to freeze it's probably 0Â° C right [Music] now this is literally I right here it's so cold this is so cool though literally so cool haly I got 100 Swiss frank if you lick it 100 Swiss frank let's see you promise hopefully your tongue doesn't get stuck to it like in that movie stop stck [Music] oh are you serious imagine starting to feel a little claustrophobic oh my gosh this is insane wow hey haey hay we're not going to let you do this the oh at least you hit me the first one she threw off camera she hit the woman behind me she doesn't have that good of a you move so now I wanted to show you guys what a dinner out here in Switzerland can cost you so we came here tonight to the top of the Met which haven't tried the food yet but these views are just miraculous this whole entire country just looks like one giant amusement park we have the church bells going right now there's trains going around everything is just picture perfect but now we're going to see what we get here for dinner hay made us get the cheese fond de so hopefully this is going to be worth it I think it's like 65 bucks so better be good or I'm Coming For You Hy [Music] so cheese fondue for the first time ever having it that was pretty darn delicious haly with food you never steer me wrong I don't but with my wallet sometimes yes so the total meal for the two of us with just getting one cheese fondue and a couple glasses of wine came out to around 120 USD but surprisingly wine as I guess in Europe is a lot cheaper than in America was only about $5 a glass so it's just that cheese fondue that uh really did US dirty like that i' still say totally worth it though it was something to it was an experience and it was delicious it was like it really was it really was good call you're welcome after looking up why Switzerland is so expensive I learned how the average salary in the country is nearly $125,000 with also having the highest minimum wage of $25 per hour on top of all this anything from Switzerland you can guarantee it will be top-of-the-line quality whether it's food or watches or trains the Swiss are magicians when it comes to engineering Good Morgan from grindlewald Switzerland today we have another very exciting actionpack day where we are taking the trim back up to a different different mountain and then going to be trotty biking down it's kind of like these crazy little tricycles that we're literally going to be taking down the mountain I don't know how but we're going to figure it out soon now to get down the mountain there are three stages with the first being flying so now for the first part of the way down we're going to be flying this is insane are you nervous yeah can't see anything oh my God just want to stay until the morning sun lay here forever you and together I just want to stay until the morning's done I just want to stay until the morning I just want to stay until the morning my first day on Earth you sang me a tune guys the Swiss do not mess around I thought it was going to be kind of this Rinky Dink little bike that you wouldn't be able to go too fast on but boy was I wrong we were flying down the mountain it is so hard to break you're going so fast also you're going through these clouds where you can possibly fall off the side of the mountain luckily both of us are still alive and now celebrating with some Swiss beer some traditional Swiss mixed with spray which I've never heard before I've never heard of this either but Hay's not a big Beer Drinker so they recommended her to get a beer mixed with sprit never heard of it it's not bad not bad I mean you really have a sweet tooth so I feel like this is perfect for you I can't tell if it's spray or beers tastes like both in one in one drink whoa this this right over here wow that's actually really good I thought it would taste funky but not a bad combination la la la la la so we made it safely down the mountain even though the roads were soaking wet and we were going through the clouds it really did just add to our adventure but we're back safely in grindle Walt and also had to make a quick stop at not a coffee cart but they got a coffee vending machine Switzerland really is a ahead of the game got a cappuccino it's like eight bucks ah some pretty good coffee so you guys saw what $300 I gets you in interlocking but now we are just a couple miles away in a town called L brunin which is much smaller and also much cheaper so when I was trying to find one of the cheaper hotels this is what we got we had no idea that we would have this balcony and this incredible view of the waterfall so I guess there are some deals out there Switzerland hard to find how to book this hotel last night but you know they're out there Switzerland really is just like one giant amusement park today we skipped the coffees and are getting a shot of Life espresso since we're going to be propelling off of a cliff into a canyon and then going to be canyoning around all of the Swiss mountains and yeah we got the uh wet suits on since it is pretty darn chill up here a little afraid of how cold this weather may be let's do this also wanted to give a huge shout out to outdoor interlocking for help making this trip so memorable very memorable for this one since she is not looking forward to this cold we're suited up like we're like diving into Antarctica so this is what we're going to be propelling down 150 ft straight down and luckily ha's going first to test it out we need someone to test the Rope you know yeah she's always makes for a great stunt dummy that's going to be you just like that well we have to do that because I am going to film her with the camera and then leave it in the car and then we'll pick it up at the end of our adventure but yeah also makes for a great excuse to have ha go first you got
