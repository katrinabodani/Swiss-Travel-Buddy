The Emmentaler cheese dairy has long been a cornerstone of Swiss cheese tourism, offering visitors a firsthand look at the production of the iconic Emmentaler AOP cheese. However, as of the end of June 2025, the facility has ceased its cheese-making operations due to economic challenges. Despite the cessation of production, the Emmentaler Schaukäserei remains a vibrant destination for cheese enthusiasts. The facility continues to offer its popular "Emmentaler Königsweg" experience – a self-guided tour that immerses visitors in the history and tradition of Emmental cheese-making through interactive exhibits and multimedia presentations. Additionally, the on-site restaurant and specialty cheese shop remain operational, providing guests with a taste of regional delicacies and a variety of Emmentaler cheeses sourced from other local dairies.
