Dating back to 1962, LÃ¤derach is still a fairly new fish in town. But don't be fooled. Just because they haven't been around for over a century doesn't mean their skills are any less perfected. Actually, the opposite is true. In 2018, the grandson of the company's founder won the title of world chocolate master. They know their trade. In many ways, the LÃ¤derach creations are a lot more exquisite than your typical chocolate bar. This family business is mostly famous for their artisanal broken chocolate , which they spice up with all kinds of interesting ingredients like candied oranges, caramelised almonds, roasted hazelnuts, cashews, strawberries, pistachios and many more. You're really spoiled for choice here. Like Lindt, LÃ¤derach opened its new visitors' centre in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. They've only been welcoming guests since November 2020. It actually still smelled of fresh paint when I went to check it out ðŸ˜€ You can visit House of LÃ¤derach either with a guided tour or on your own. In my opinion, both options are a fantastic opportunity to learn everything about their history as well as the chocolate-making process. They even have a viewing room inside the factory , from where your tour guide explains what is happening in which machine. The highlight of the visitors' centre has to be the three-part chocolate fountain â€“ which has dark, milk and white chocolate streaming down the same fountain.
