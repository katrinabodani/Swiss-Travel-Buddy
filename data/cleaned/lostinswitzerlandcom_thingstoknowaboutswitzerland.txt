Are you visiting Switzerland for the first time? Or have you been here before but you feel like there are some basic things you wish you'd known earlier? While Switzerland is an easy destination to explore on your own, there are a few things that can help you make the most of your trip. Here’s everything you need to know before visiting Switzerland for the first time. 1. Languages Switzerland has four official languages: (Swiss) German, French, Italian and Romansh. The language spoken depends on the region, so don’t be surprised if road signs change as you travel. English is widely spoken in tourist areas, but learning a few basic phrases in the local language is always appreciated. If you'd like to know more about that, I've put together a small Swiss language guide for you. Map of where each language is spoken in Switzerland 2. Swiss German is different from standard German If you speak German, you may still find Swiss German dialects hard to understand. However, locals usually switch to High German in professional and tourist settings if needed. Just don't expect it to sound as perfectly as it does in Germany. We have our own unique way of pronouncing things. 3. Currency, ATMs and payments Switzerland uses the Swiss Franc (CHF), not the Euro. While some places accept Euros, the exchange rate is rarely in your favor. The Swiss banking system is well-developed and ATMs (known locally as Bancomats) are widely available in cities, towns and even many rural areas. Most ATMs accept major international credit and debit cards. While credit cards are commonly used, some smaller businesses, mountain huts and rural guesthouses may only accept cash. (Read more about travel money in Switzerland here.) Contactless payment is widely used, so mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay work in most places. However, it’s always a good idea to carry some Swiss Francs, especially if you plan to visit smaller towns or take public transport where card payments may not always be possible. The currency used in Switzerland is called Swiss Franc (CHF) There are ATMs everywhere if you're in need of some cash By the way, you're going to stumble across the name "Twint" lots of times while you're in Switzerland. This is a payment app the Swiss use to exchange money between friends or pay for things. Most places accept Twint payments. Even alpine mountain huts selling their cheese! However, this app is only available to people with a Swiss phone number. But just to let you know what it is once you come across it. 4. Switzerland is expensive Sadly, there’s no way around it. And it's an open secret. Switzerland is one of the most expensive countries to visit. Accommodation, food and transport all don't come cheap. However, there are ways to manage costs, like choosing supermarkets for meals, checking out some free things to do or picking the right travel pass for transport savings. If you're unsure wheter or not the Swiss Travel Pass makes sense for your trip, I've written plenty of content on that subject. You can even tell me your plans and I'll calculate the best option for you if you like. 5. Power plugs are different Switzerland uses Type J power sockets, which may not be compatible with standard European plugs. Bring an adapter if needed. This is what our power sockets look like And these are the plugs that fit in them 6. A small country with big diversity Despite its relatively small size, Switzerland offers an great mix of landscapes and cultures all packed in a very limited space. While you can drive for hours and hours in bigger countries like Australia, Chile, Canada or the US without the landscape changing much at all, this won't happen to you in Switzerland. You can drive across the country more than once in a day if you wish - St. Gallen to Geneva takes around four hours - but you will encounter all sorts of landscapes and cultures. Even different languages, as you now know. Let me give you an example. The Italian-speaking Ticino region feels Mediterranean, with palm-lined lakes, colorful villages and an Italian flair in food and architecture. In contrast, Zurich is a modern financial hub with a thriving arts scene and vibrant nightlife. The vineyards near Lake Geneva offer scenic countryside views and world-class wine, while the Swiss Alps provide some amazing scenery. No matter where you go, each region has its own charm and unique identity, making Switzerland feel like several countries in one. You can visit the vineyards of Lavaux by Lake Geneva... ... and the city of St. Gallen in Eastern Switzerland in one day. 7. Efficient public transport Switzerland’s public transport system is one of the best in the world. Trains, trams, buses and boats are punctual and well-connected. The Swiss Travel Pass is a great option for unlimited travel on the network. Of course, renting a car is also possible and popular in Switzerland, but you can reach almost every corner of the country by public transport.

It borders five countries Switzerland shares borders with Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein. This makes it easy to combine your trip with a visit to a neighboring country, often without long travel times. Even short day trips abroad are possible. 9. We're not in the EU Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, though it has agreements with the EU on trade and travel. If you’re an EU citizen, border crossings are usually smooth. For travellers from other countries, visa regulations apply. Which brings us to... 10. Visa regulations Switzerland is part of the Schengen Zone, meaning travellers from many countries can visit visa-free for up to 90 days. If you need a visa, apply in advance, as requirements vary depending on nationality. For the most up-to-date information, visit the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) website .

Each holding its charm. Winter (December to February): The Alps turn into a winter wonderland, perfect for skiing, snowboarding and sipping hot chocolate in cozy mountain chalets. Christmas markets pop up in cities, adding to the magical atmosphere. Spring (March to May): Nature wakes up, and so do the hiking trails. Flowers bloom, waterfalls roar with melting snow and lakes look more vibrant than ever. It’s a great time for sightseeing before the summer crowds arrive. Summer (June to August): Long days and warm temperatures make it the best season for outdoor activities. Whether it’s hiking , swimming in alpine lakes , river rafting or taking scenic train rides , everything is in full swing. It’s also festival season, with events happening all over the country. Autumn (September to November): The vineyards near Lake Geneva and Valais turn golden and the crisp air makes hiking even more enjoyable. It’s the perfect time for wine tasting, scenic drives and fewer crowds at major attractions. Summer is great for hiking... ... while winter calls for a day in a ski resort. 12.

The country is consistently ranked as one of the safest in the world, making it ideal for independent exploration. With well-marked trails, efficient public transport and a welcoming atmosphere, you won’t have trouble getting around. Many locals speak English, which helps with navigation, and the high standard of infrastructure ensures a smooth travel experience. It's also safe to drive your own vehicle if you're planning on renting a car and going on a Swiss road trip . 13. Two major airports Switzerland’s main international airports are in Zurich and Geneva, with Zurich being the busiest. Both have excellent public transport connections, making it easy to start your trip right after landing. 14. Tap water is excellent Switzerland’s tap water is some of the cleanest in the world. You can drink from almost any tap or fountain unless marked otherwise. Skip bottled water. It’s expensive and unnecessary. Just carry your own bottle and refill it as you go. Fill your water bottle along the way... All year round 15. Sunday closures Most shops and supermarkets are closed on Sundays, except at train stations and airports. Plan ahead if you need groceries or shopping time. 16. Grocery stores close early Outside of major cities, supermarkets often close by 7 or 8 PM. Plan your shopping accordingly. 17. No tipping culture Service charges are included in restaurant bills, so tipping is not expected like it is for example in the US or in Canada. However, rounding up to the nearest franc or leaving some change is appreciated for good service. 18. Hiking is a national pastime With well-marked trails across the country, hiking is one of the best ways to experience Switzerland’s stunning landscapes. Even beginners will find plenty of easy, scenic routes. Switzerland is a paradise for hikers, with over 65,000 kilometers of well-maintained and clearly marked trails that range from gentle lakeside walks to challenging alpine ascents. The best part? Access to these trails is completely free. Trails are well-signposted, making navigation easy, and many are accessible via Switzerland’s excellent public transport system. Hiking is one of my favourite ways to explore Switzerland It's free and it takes you to the most stunning places! 19. Swiss cheese and chocolate are a must-try Switzerland is world-famous for its cheese and chocolate. So tasting them is a must. Swiss cheese comes in a variety of flavors and textures, from creamy fondue-friendly Gruyère to the holey, mild Emmental. Visiting a traditional cheese factory lets you see the process up close. If you're a chocolate lover, Switzerland won’t disappoint you, either. The country is home to some of the finest chocolate makers in the world, offering everything from silky smooth milk chocolate to intense dark varieties. Make sure you visit one of our chocolate factories while you're here. Try some Swiss cheese... ... and chocolate while you're here. 20. Mountain cable cars are everywhere Switzerland’s mountain cable cars make it easy to reach breathtaking peaks and panoramic viewpoints without the need for intense hiking. Whether you're heading up to Jungfraujoch, the “ Top of Europe ,” or gliding above Lake Lucerne on the way to Mount Pilatus , these cable cars offer some of the most stunning views in the Alps. Some rides, like the rotating cable car to Mount Titlis , even add a unique twist to the journey. While they can be pricey, they provide easy access to high-altitude adventures, making them a must for first-time visitors looking to experience Switzerland’s iconic landscapes without too much effort. There are lots of mountains accessible by mountain railway (Photo: Brienz Rothorn Bahn Rabea Hüppi) Train to Jungfraujoch in winter (Photo: Jungfrau Railways) 21. The Swiss appreciate punctuality The Swiss take punctuality seriously and you’ll quickly notice that everything runs on schedule. Trains, buses and even social appointments are expected to start right on time. Being late is generally frowned upon, so if you have plans with locals, make sure to arrive on time. 22. Lakes are perfect for swimming Switzerland’s lakes are some of the cleanest in the world, making them perfect for a refreshing swim, especially in the summer months. From the turquoise waters of Lake Brienz to the vast expanse of Lake Geneva, there’s no shortage of scenic spots to take a dip. Many lakes have designated swimming areas, with floating platforms, changing facilities and even beachside cafés. Like most lakes, Oeschinensee is perfect for swimming.
