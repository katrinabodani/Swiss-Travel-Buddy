Ever since I started my travel consulting services and helping people plan their trip to Switzerland, there's one pain point that has been standing out. "I'm worried I'm not going to catch the right train. " "I'm confused with all the trains and timetables." "What happens if I miss a train? How do I find an alternative?" These are all things I've heard from people who reached out to me in a personal 1:1 call . While Switzerland is blessed with an excellent public transport system , it also has its downsides. The sheer amount of options available is especially overwhelming for people visiting Switzerland for the first time. I've written a ton of articles about getting around in Switzerland . About the Swiss Travel Pass, the Swiss Half Fare Card, public transport in general, renting a car and so on... You can find an overview of all these articles here and I highly recommend browsing through a few to get a good idea of what to expect in terms of transportation in Switzerland. But for now, I'm going to take a closer look at Swiss timetables to help you understand how you can navigate this jungle once you're here. The good news? It's a lot easier than it first seems at first sight. The SBB timetable, your best friend First things first. And this is not just a recommendation. It's almost a must if you plan on travelling through Switzerland by public transport. Download. The. SBB. App! Really, get the app. It's available for iOS and Android and you can find the link right here on the SBB website . If you don't want to download the app and you prefer using your computer or your mobile browser, visit the SBB timetable instead. They're both perfect to help you schedule your trip. How to read a timetable entry Once you've entered your departure and destination points along with the date and time, the SBB timetable will show you a list of possible connections. The way this information appears differs slightly depending on whether you're using the desktop version or the SBB app. ... in the SBB app The first thing you'll see after running a search is a list of compact cards. Each representing one possible connection. At first glance, these cards show only the most essential information: departure and arrival times , duration , number of transfers and any potential disruption symbols. To access the full details of a connection, you need to tap on the card . This will open up an expanded view with all the specifics you need to understand your trip. Also, you might notice a small percent symbol (%) in the bottom-right corner of the compact card. This indicates that a Supersaver Ticket is available for that particular connection. These discounted fares are limited in number and are always tied to specific departure times. They offer a great way to save money if your schedule is flexible. This is what you see in the SBB app once you enter your point of origin, destination, date and time. Here's what you'll find in that expanded view: Top left: Departure time and station Top right: Arrival time and destination Middle line: Shows the route with any transfers (e.g. via Bern ) Bottom row: Duration, number of changes, and platform number (if available) Red or yellow symbols: Indicate delays, cancellations, or disruption notices Tap on a connection to see more details, including: Exact train types and numbers (e.g. IC 5, IR 15) Intermediate stops with times Transfer times and platform information Walking distances between platforms (for tight transfers) Live status updates if you're checking shortly before departure Select a connection to view the details of your trip. The app updates in real time, so this is where you'll find the most accurate information. Especially on the day of travel. ... on the SBB website The first step is entering your origin, destination, date and time. Once you've hit search, you'll see a list of possible connections presented in a table format. This is what the timetable looks like once you've entered your details. Clicking on a connection expands it into a full itinerary: Departure and arrival stations and times are displayed in more detail Train numbers and types (e.g. IC, IR, RE) are shown for each leg of the journey Intermediate stops with arrival and departure times Platform information for all changes, when available Transfer details , including walking distances between platforms if necessary Real-time updates in case of delays or disruptions Saver Ticket indicator (% symbol) if applicable, showing potential discounts Options to add to your calendar , save as a PDF or print the connection This layout is especially helpful when you're planning multi-leg routes or want to compare several options side by side before choosing one. Find more details about your connection by clicking on it. Real-time vs. scheduled information Switzerland's trains are famously punctual, but nothing is immune to disruption. This is where the SBB app and website come in handy with their real-time updates. If a train is delayed, cancelled or rerouted , the app and website update the timetable and give you alternatives. Red warning symbols will appear next to affected routes. Clicking into the route provides details about the issue and how to adapt your plan. This is one of the main reasons I recommend relying on the app and website instead of printed schedules. Especially if you're checking the schedule on your day of travel. Which I always recommend you do. If something is wrong with your train, the SBB timetable will let you know... Filtering and customising your search The SBB timetable isn't just a static list of connections. You can shape your search in various ways to suit your preferences. Just click on "settings" to start customising: Direct connections only if you don't want to change trains Set your earliest departure or latest arrival time Include or exclude transport types (e.g. no buses, only trains) Add a "via" station to take a specific route or make a scenic detour Show earlier or later options if you're flexible These options help reduce overwhelm and let you filter out journeys that don't work for you. In the app, you first need to add your connection before you can set your filters. On desktop, you can start filtering right away There are quite a few filters that can help you plan your trip if you have special requirements. Planning with connections in mind A lot of people stress about changing trains. But don't worry. Swiss stations are built for efficiency and the entire system is designed to make connections as smooth as possible. Here are a few tips to keep in mind: Minimum connection time is usually around 5-7 minutes, which is plenty for most Swiss stations thanks to short walking distances and punctual arrivals If you're travelling with lots of luggage, young kids or simply want to reduce stress, aim for 10-15 minutes When checking your timetable, note the platform numbers . The app or website will often show you both the departure and arrival platforms, so you can assess how far you might need to walk Follow the signs and digital boards. Swiss stations are well signposted and if you're unsure, station staff or fellow passengers are often happy to help In major hubs like Zurich HB or Bern, consider allowing extra time during busy travel periods, especially if you need to switch from one end of the station to the other Offline access and printed schedules If you don't have mobile data , are travelling through rural areas or simply want a backup, it's a good idea to prepare a little before heading out: Save your route in the app by using the favourites or share options so it stays accessible offline Take screenshots of the expanded timetable view, including platform info and any transfer details Use the PDF export option on the desktop version if you want to print or save your entire itinerary as a document At most train stations, you'll find printed timetables posted on yellow and white board s. Yellow boards show all departures from that station while white boards show all arrivals You'll also find digital displays on the platforms and in station halls with live updates Although offline access isn't always necessary, having a printed or saved reference can be reassuring, especially on longer travel days or if your mobile signal is unreliable. Most train stations have a digital board with the latest timetable information. Missing a train... This is where people panic most: What if something doesn't go as planned? Unless you have a Supersaver Ticket that's restricted to a certain connection or you have a seat reservation, don't worry. Just get on the next train. Swiss public transport is known for its high frequency and excellent connections. That means: You usually won't have to wait long for the next train or bus The SBB app allows you to search from your current location , making replanning incredibly quick If you're using a Swiss Travel Pass or any other non-reservation-based ticket, you're not tied to one specific departure. You can just take the next available connection Use the SBB app to check the next departures from your station in real time, get updates on platform changes or delays or search an entirely new route if your destination or timing changes. Problem solved... And with all this information, you should be able to navigate the Swiss train schedules like a pro.
