Switzerland – for me, it was always the place I wanted to see since childhood, but it always remained a distant dream until last year, when we planned a trip to the heart of Europe with the entire family, including my mother, who is 70 years old. Multiple Instagram reels and vlogs helped us weave our itinerary. Additionally, a few office friends who had visited Switzerland before gave us valuable suggestions and essential information. As our travel day neared, I couldn’t help but feel the childhood nostalgia of “ Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge ” and “ Darr ,” both movies were filmed in Switzerland’s stunning locations. I recently rewatched both movies and began imagining myself in those green meadows of the Swiss valley, enjoying the gentle cool mist caressing my face.

In addition, we had a duffle bag filled with our jackets, some Indian ready-to-eat packets, a medical kit, and an umbrella. Our backpacks were also packed with a camera, a GoPro, a power bank, laptops, various chargers, and travel pillows, ensuring we had everything we needed for our trip. BluSmart – Not a smart decision I booked an XL BluSmart cab two days in advance, expecting a spacious 6-seater. On the travel day, a Tata Nexon showed up instead. Fitting ourselves and our luggage into that car was like playing Tetris in real life! We managed to squeeze in, but it wasn’t easy. Pro tip: go for an Uber XL next time—same price, less stress, and no Tetris skills required! BluSmart – Not so smart decision Encalm Lounge, T-3 Delhi – expensive With some time to kill at Delhi International Airport, we decided to hit the Lounge instead of loitering in the open. Turns out, the Encalm Lounge had a thing against Mastercards—they only accepted Visa or Amex. Luckily, I had three Visa cards that worked like a charm, charging me just Rs 2 each. For the last member, I had to use my Amex and got slapped with an Rs 885 fee. The Lounge was buzzing with morning travelers, and the breakfast line felt like it stretched to infinity. We spent the next two hours munching on breakfast, reading newspapers, and plotting our trip for the week. The flight boarded right on schedule, and by 10:30 hrs, we were ready to depart for Dubai. At Encalm Lounge, T-3 Delhi Flight to Zurich The 11-Jun flight EK511 to from Delhi to Dubai seemed like a refreshing break from Air India—cleaner seats, functional screens, and earphones that actually worked. It felt like we made a good choice. Wrong! Daniel’s Service: A Bumpy Ride at 30,000 ft The pre-booked Hindu Vegetarian meals we had our hearts set on? Nowhere to be found. No explanation. And then there was Daniel, or as I’ve affectionately named him, “Denial.” Twice, he skipped us with the drink cart, while serving others—no drinks, no reason, just a cold ignore, perhaps purposely. When we finally asked for water, he decided he was too busy for us and sent in his co-attendant after a while. This made us feel uncomfortable and awkward. Once could be a slip-up, but twice? Definitely not accidental. Emirates, you’ve got some explaining to do! At that moment, I vowed to reach out to Emirates over email and share my disappointment with their service. I also decided to feature Daniel’s name, the flight details, and the date on my blog. Emirates complaint Emirates complaint Dubai We arrived in Dubai on time. It is a huge airport with glittering duty-free shops, Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis everywhere, and amazing infrastructure. Three hours flew by in a flash, and before we knew it, we were boarding our next flight (EK085) bound for Zurich, Switzerland. Dubai International Airport Blacklane Cabs: Taking Detours from Dependability Smooth sailing all the way from Dubai, and voila, touchdown in Zurich right on schedule. Immigration was a breeze, and just like that, bags in hand—we were ready to roll! My wife had traveled from the US a week ago and was provided a complimentary coupon for BLACKLANE cabs. As we knew the flight would arrive in Zurich at around 20.30 hrs, we booked their cab 10 days in advance and paid upfront, ignoring the avalanche of horrible reviews that had flooded the TripAdvisor page. Guess what? When we touch down in Zurich, there’s no sweet ‘cab details’ message waiting for us. Nope, nada. Instead, I’m hit with an email saying they couldn’t locate a chauffeur, so they’re pulling the plug on our ride. This was the second fiasco in a day after Emirates. Travelling is indeed an experience! B&B Hotel, Zurich By 21:45 hrs, panic mode was in full swing as we desperately tried to summon an Uber, only to face the dreaded “long wait” message. Just when all seemed lost, like a beacon of hope, a local taxi with an Afghan driver appeared out of the Zurich night. He gave us a fair deal, and we hopped on to his taxi. It was my second ride with an Afghan driver (the first time was in the US), and it hit me—India-Afghanistan camaraderie isn’t just about cricket; it travels well beyond borders. Finally, we reached the hotel at around 22.00 hrs. We were not hungry, so we ditched the dinner, though my son had a subway. I was surprised to see that it was priced at CHF 16.50, approx. Rs 1570. “Damn! Switzerland, you pricey little devil,” I couldn’t help but blurt out. But I knew if I kept converting every expense into rupees, I’d end up crying into my Swiss chocolate. So, I ditched the mental math and geared up for the next eight days of Swiss experience. Gotta keep the wallet—and the spirits—upbeat! Day 2 (12-Jun-2024) – Rhine Falls, Schaffhausen & Engelberg I had a night that felt like a wrestling match with insomnia, tossing and turning until the wee hours. Around 6 a.m., I surrendered to the fact that sleep wasn’t happening—thanks to a front-facing hotel room overlooking the parking lot! Those car headlights played tag with my eyelids all night, turning my sleep into a game of hide-and-seek. We rolled out of bed and were raring to go by 8:00 AM, hungry for breakfast. The B&B served up the standard english morning spread—nothing to write extensively about, but it did the job. After fueling up our tummies, we bid adieu to our room and dropped our bags at reception. Rhine Falls, Switzerland Next stop? The Rumlang train station. Picture us strutting down the street like we own it, ready to catch a train to Neuhausen Rhine Falls station—only a breezy 45 minutes away. Rumlang Train Station As we reached there by 10.00 am, the first glimpse of the waterfalls stole my heart. Water cascaded down with all its might, pounding those rocks like it was on a mission. At its widest, it was like nature’s scare, plunging down the hillock and forming this serene pool below. We hopped on a 30-minute ferry ride that got us up close and personal with the falls. But let’s be real—it’s no Niagara Falls, that powerhouse of majestic waterworks. Still, Rhine Falls has style and roar ! Rhine Falls, Switzerland We clicked numerous pics and satiated the photographer within us. Our happy faces, still not tired, glowed along with the falls on which sun rays were falling. The first day at Zurich had started off well. VIDEO Rhine Falls Boat Ride Rhine Falls, Switzerland Schaffhausen After spending around two hours at the falls, we started for our next destination, Schaffhausen, this charming town a mere 10-minute train ride away, nestled snugly by the River Rhine. As we emerged from the train station, Vorstadt Street greeted us with a bustling market scene. With lunchtime hunger gnawing at us, the sign of McDonald’s was too strong to resist—burger meals, here we come! Schaffhausen Bellies satisfied, we sauntered along the Rhine River and stumbled upon Rhybadi, an open swimming pool right on the river. Despite the chilly 15°C weather, kids were splashing around like it was the Caribbean. After a leisurely stroll, we made tracks back to our hotel in Rumlang to fetch our bags. Next stop: Engelberg via Luzern. Rhybadi, Schaffhausen Engelberg By the time we reached Luzern, it was around 17.00 hrs. It was a huge train station, but thanks to the trusty SBB app, we had all the intel we needed. No need to play the lost tourist card—we strutted straight to the platform where our Engelberg train was parked. We snagged seats in the humble abode of second class—no fancy reservations required, just the good old-fashioned way of hop-on-to-the-train action. Right on the dot, the train chugged away from Luzern, treating us to an hour of scenic eye candy. We reached Engelberg station by 18.15 hrs. Luzern Train Station Engelberg Town Since the Tourism office had closed, our hosts had arranged for the apartment keys to be picked up from the H+ Hotel, which was just across the train station. We picked up the keys and started walking towards our apartment, which was another 5-minute walk. However, we were tired after walking for the full day, and with the luggage, it seemed a daunting task. Thank the travel gods for flat terrain and asphalted sidewalks, it was manageable. Engelberg Town Engelberg apartment As we stepped into the apartment, it felt like stepping into a warm hug—cozy, comfortable, and oh-so-inviting. The kitchen was a treasure trove, stocked with everything a hungry traveler could dream of. Dinner was a no-brainer with those trusty ready-to-eat packs. Dal Makhni, roti, and paratha to the rescue—because who wants to cook after a day of gallivanting? After a blissful shower that washed away the day’s adventures, we collapsed onto the bed like we’d just conquered a mountain (well, almost—tomorrow was reserved for Mount Titlis and Stanserhorn). With visions of cable cars and alpine views dancing in my head, I welcomed the sweet embrace of sleep. Ah, finally, the end of a marathon day. Engelberg Town Day 3 (13-Jun-2024) – Mount Titlis & Stanserhorn , Switzerland I woke up to the sound of drizzle, and my first thought was, “Great, Mount Titlis is probably getting a snowstorm.” But it seemed like the sun took pity on us and decided to grace us with its presence by the time we were ready. Our smiles came back, too, right on cue. Mount Titlis , Switzerland The cable car station to Titlis was just a short walk away from the apartment, so we strolled along the river, soaking in the scenery as we made our way to the ticket counter. We traded our paper tickets for fancy barcode-enabled ones, which included the ice flyer, an open cable car. VIDEO A walk towards Mount Titlis Cable Car station Titlis barcode-enabled tickets Mount Titlis Cable car from Engelberg Town There were two ropeways to conquer here – First one, the ‘normal ropeway,’ which whisked us away to Stand via Trubsee. Then came the pièce de résistance—the revolving Titlis Rotair cable car, spinning us up to the summit at a dizzying 3020 meters. The whole trip from Engelberg to Titlis was a breezy 30-minute ride packed with breathtaking views and a whole lot of excitement! Mount Titlis Cable car Mount Titlis Summit Reaching the summit felt like stepping into the winter wonderland of Khardungla, Ladakh . In just half an hour, the scenery had transformed from lush green to pure, dazzling white. The hills were so white they resembled vampire’s teeth, and the mountain peaks resembled harpoon tips, all cloaked in a ghost-grey mist. The air was so cold it felt like it could freeze your thoughts, with the temperature plummeting to -6°C. Mount Titlis Once we disembarked the Rotair, it was time to dive into the snow world. My DSLR and cell phone went into overdrive, and for the first time, I wished I had a third hand to handle the GoPro. I snapped away like a paparazzo on a mission and quickly realized I had already taken over 150 pics. It was just like the gondola ride to summit in Gulmarg, Kashmir , but tad bit cleaner and with fewer people. An icy paradise, captured from every angle! Titlis Rotair cable car VIDEO Mount Titlis Titlis Cliff Walk One of the coolest things, aside from the jaw-dropping views, was all the fun activities that kept us engaged.First one, the Titlis Cliff Walk—a short jaunt across a secured suspension bridge that dangled us over a 500-meter-deep glacier gorge. As we strolled from the top station to the bridge’s end, we experienced 100 meters of pure adrenaline. The bridge swayed just enough to keep things interesting, making it an exhilarating walk. A thrill ride! Just a friendly tip: Keep small items like keys and selfie stick remotes securely in your pockets. If they fall, say goodbye forever! View from Titlis Cliff Walk The Ice Flyer The second and most gripping adventure was The Ice Flyer. Imagine an open gondola ride to the opposite mountain – scary yet exciting! We soared over huge snow fields that glistened in the sunlight, peering straight down into the snow-white depths of crevasses stretching all the way to the bottom of the eternal ice glaciers. At first, it was a bit terrifying, but once we got over the initial jitters, it turned into one of the best experiences ever. We couldn’t help but marvel at the breathtaking views and the sheer excitement of flying over a frozen wonderland. Ice Flyer Sliding down the Glacier Park Last but certainly not least was the adventure slide in Glacier Park. Picture this: sliding down the mountain on a snow tube, skidding, and picking up speed with a pounding heart. I enjoyed this thrilling activity twice, but lugging the snow tube back uphill through knee-deep snow was an uphill task. After two runs, I gave up. But honestly, if they had a travelator to carry both me and the snow tube back up, I could have ridden that slide all day long! VIDEO Mount Titlis Slide Lunch at Spice Bistro By the time we made it back to Engelberg with a stopover at Lake Trubsee, our stomachs were rumbling—it was definitely lunchtime! Upon checking the trusty SBB app, we discovered the next train to Stans would depart in an hour. That gave us just enough time to grab a quick bite. Luckily, right outside the Titlis cable car ticket station, we spotted ‘ Spice Bistro ,’ an Indian fast-food joint. Sure, it was a bit pricey (as expected), but it turned out to be the best Indian food we had during our entire Swiss trip. The Pav Bhaji was downright delicious, seriously yummy stuff. The only surprise? We had to clean our own table and trash the disposable plates after we ate. Nothing wrong in doing it, just that we were not used to this way of living, as we all are used to being pampered diners back home in India. Lake Trubsee Stanserhorn, Switzerland The walk after tasty lunch to Engelberg station was going to be difficult, I knew. We took 20 mins and a quick break for a ten minutes’ walk. The train departed on time and took about 30 mins to reach Stans train station. The Stanserhorn ‘inclined rail’ station was just 5-minute walk from the main train station. The inclined rail was ready and the tickets were included in the Swiss pass. After a swift ten-minute ride on the inclined train, we hopped onto an open-top cable car that ferried us up to the summit of Stanserhorn. It being a relatively unexplored place, our enjoyment was heightened by the absence of crowds. VIDEO A journey to Stanserhorn Stanserhorn Stanserhorn, nestled in Switzerland’s Nidwalden canton near Obwalden, reaches an impressive 1,898 meters (6,227 ft) above sea level. From its summit, behold stunning vistas of Lake Lucerne, the verdant Engelberg valley, and panoramic mountain views in all directions. It is probably one of the lesser-known mountain peaks in the region, but it is truly awesome – a hidden gem. If you’re feeling more energetic, there are plenty of hikes around. Stanserhorn The ride back to Engelberg was a quiet one. Returning, we savored the last of our Indian meal we’d brought along… Paneer Makhani. What a fantastic day it was… Mount Titlis – you stole my heart. Stanserhorn Day 4 (14-Jun-2024) – Mount Rigi & Luzern City Engelberg to Mount Rigi was around three hours one way ride. The plan was to take train from Engelberg to Luzern, the hop on to ferry from Luzern to Vitznau and finally a cog rail from Vitznau to Rigi Kulm, which was the last stop. On the way back, the itinerary was just as exciting: a train from Rigi Kulm to Arth Goldau, then another one to Luzern. After a bit of exploring in Luzern city, we’d make our way back to Engelberg. A day packed with trains, ferries, and stunning Swiss scenery—what more could we ask for? Engelberg – Vitznau – Rigi Kulm We left our Airbnb right on schedule and arrived at the Luzern train station, with the ferry boarding conveniently located just across the street. The 50-minute ferry ride was scenic and relaxing. Upon reaching Vitznau, the Rigi cog rail was already waiting for us right outside the ferry station. VIDEO Mount Rigi Vitznau, Switzerland cogwheel train journey Thanks to our Swiss pass, the entire train and ferry journey was covered. The cog rail ride took about 40 minutes to reach the summit named Rigi Kulm, but every moment was worth it. The views were spectacular, and the experience was simply unforgettable. View from Mount Rigi Mount Rigi , Switzerland As we reached the top, the sun was shining but the wind made it quite chilly. The view of the lush green valley with snow-clad mountains in the background was picture perfect. While our fellow passengers quickly disembarked and trekked to the highest viewpoint, we decided to first savor the sandwiches we had prepared and carried with us. Rigi Kulm With our stomachs happy, we unleashed our inner photographers and clicked countless pics. Then, reality hit: the uphill trek to the viewpoint was going to be too much for my mom. We bought her a coffee at a cozy café nearby and left our backpacks with her while we took on the trek. With only 25 minutes until the return train, we sped to the top, snapped some amazing pics, and made it back just in time. The view of Luzern city and the lake from the viewpoint was absolutely mesmerizing. Mount Rigi Mount Rigi Rigi Kulm – Arth Goldau – Luzern The journey from Mount Rigi to Luzern was absolutely breathtaking, with green meadows and sparkling lakes unfolding before our eyes. However, after the cold and windy heights of Mount Rigi, Luzern felt like a warm, slightly humid hug. Mount Rigi view Chapel Bridge, Luzern , Switzerland We decided to stroll over to the nearby Chapel Bridge, constructed way back in 1333 A.D. When it comes to Luzern, everyone raves about Chapel Bridge. It’s an iconic monument – much like identity of Lucerne. At first glance, you might think, “It’s just a bridge,” but if you just stop and admire the beauty and its surrounding, this looks impressive. Chapel Bridge Across the Reuss River, a delightful array of quick-bite shops, cafes, ice-cream parlors, and restaurants awaits. An evening walk along the riverfront with an ice-cream cone in hand is simply priceless, letting you truly absorb the charming atmosphere. Chapel Bridge After snapping some pics, we dashed to Luzern station to catch our train back to Engelberg. All in all, it was a fabulous day filled with jaw-dropping scenery at Mount Rigi and the lively vibes of Luzern. We enjoyed every bit of it and ended the day on a high note, quite literally. VIDEO Lucerne city walk around Chapel Bridge Day 5 (15-Jun-2024) – Montreux – Golden Pass Express – Interlaken – Lauterbrunnen – Wengen We were all set for our early escape to catch the 7:00 am train to Luzern. Bags packed, breakfast devoured, garbage disposed of like responsible adults, and the clock showing a promising 6:30 am. But of course, the universe had a plot twist in store for us: Ready or not, here came the downpour! Swiss rains It felt like the heavens had decided to dump an ocean on us. Waiting for it to stop was futile. Luzern was cloudy, Montreux was overcast, but at least they promised no rain—lucky them. We suited up in our raincoats and popped open our umbrellas, ready for the battle ahead. Engelberg train station was a mere 5-minute walk away, but it could take 10 mins with luggage. Only my bag didn’t have a hard top, so there was a chance my clothes could get wet. With no other option, we locked up, dropped the key in the return box, and braved the storm like wet, determined adventurers! By the time we splashed our way to the train station, it was 06:50 am. We still had a solid 10 minutes to spare. I remembered that we had forgotten to refill our bottles at the apartment! In Switzerland, everyone refills their bottles straight from the ever-flowing fountains—no button-pushing drama like in the US. Our raincoats had kept us mostly dry, but my poor bag looked like it had gone for a swim. No point in checking the damage on the platform; we’d find out in Wengen, I thought. Engelberg to Montreux The train left Engelberg right on time, and by 8:00 am, we reached Luzern. No rain, but clouds were hanging around like they owned the place—just as the weather apps had forecasted. The next journey was our train to Lausanne via Bern, a ride that promised two hours of scenic boredom. Once in Lausanne, we hopped onto another train bound for Montreux, a swift 25-minute ride. Train stations displayed within trains We finally landed in Montreux around 11:00 am. Our brilliant plan had one Achilles’ heel: stashing our luggage in the electronic lockers at the platform. I couldn’t shake the feeling we’d be out of luck, staring at an occupied locker, wondering what to do with our soggy bags! View from Train Montreux , Switzerland It seemed the stars were finally smiling on us. We got an empty giant XL luggage locker that happily swallowed all our bags for CHF 15. With our luggage securely stowed, my inner peace was restored. Carrying only our small backpacks now felt like a breeze. We hopped on another train from Montreux to Veytaux-Chillon, the closest station to the lakeside Chateau de Chillon. From there, it was just a 5-7 minute stroll to the castle—practically a victory lap! Keyless luggage locker The view outside Chateau de Chillon was stunning, even outshining the castle’s interior. After some castle exploration, we stepped outside to soak in the lake and the castle’s exterior. The photographer in us went into overdrive; with views like these, it was impossible to take a bad picture. Chateau de Chillon View from Chateau de Chillon View from Chateau de Chillon After capturing every angle, we headed back to Montreux station, retrieved our bags, and eagerly awaited the star of our trip—the Golden Pass Express. This train ride, offering breathtaking views between Montreux and Interlaken, was the Numero Uno attraction. It was the only train we’d booked seats from India, and we couldn’t wait to embark on this scenic journey. Veytaux-Chillon Train Station The Golden Pass Express , Switzerland The Golden Pass Express departed on time, at 14.30 hrs and was scheduled to reach Interlaken around 18.00 hrs. As the train moved slowly, the landscape changed dramatically with each turn bringing in better views. First, it was the lake view, then came a valley, the next were green meadows on either sides with beautiful Swiss cottages. VIDEO Golden Pass train Montreux to Interlaken Golden Pass Express As we were about to reach Interlaken, it was lake view again. First came Lake Thun which is deep blue and the next one, the larger Lake Brienz, was turquoise blue. The entire journey kept us engaged with the views it offered – simply paradisiacal. View from The Golden Pass Express View from The Golden Pass Express Interlaken – Lauterbrunnen – Wengen We got down at Interlaken and hopped onto a train to Lauterbrunnen which is supposedly the most picturesque village of Switzerland. From Lauterbrunnen, we boarded our final train of the day to Wengen. Since Wengen is located at a height, the journey takes about 20 mins. From the train once can enjoy the views of the famous Staubbach falls of Lauterbrunnen. As we reached Wengen train station after 18.00 hrs, the ubiquitous Coop superstore had closed for the day. So, we decided to explore some Indian restaurant there after checking in to our Wengen Airbnb. The restaurant, Golden India was perhaps the only Indian cuisine restaurant in Wengen. However, I was disappointed, no not because it was expensive, but perhaps because it did not serve Roti, Nan or any tandoori dish, only rice. The food was bland and tasteless. Now, I wished, I could have had a pizza or Swiss’ favorite dish – the fondue. Wengen It was a long day today. We had travelled almost half way across the Switzerland today. After settling down in Fortuna Chalet, Wengen, we just dozed off. It would be another long day tomorrow, I mumbled. Day 6 (16-Jun-2024) – Jungfraujoch & Lauterbrunnen I had always seen pics of my friends visiting Jungfraujoch who had vacationed in Switzerland. Deep down, I too had an inherent desire to visit those white Swiss Alps, and today, the day had come. Classic Travel Blunder To beat the crowd, we boarded the 08:00 train from Wengen to Kleine Scheidegg. Just as we were getting comfy, the ticket collector dropped a bombshell. Turns out, we needed to exchange our paper tickets for barcode ones back at Wengen, not Kleine Scheidegg. Our options? Forfeit our paper tickets and shell out CHF 85 per person for new ones or do the train shuffle back to Wengen. With no other choice, we rode the shuttle back to Wengen, swapped our tickets, and hopped on the train again. By the time we got back to Kleine Scheidegg, we had lost an hour, and the crowds had swarmed in. Classic travel blunder, but at least we got some extra train rides! Wengen Jungfraujoch , Switzerland From Kleine Scheidegg to Jungfraujoch, we hopped on the ‘Jungfraubahn,’ a train that tunnels its way to the summit. While Jungfrau is an engineering marvel, the train ride itself isn’t exactly a thrill-fest for tourists. After a 5-minute scenic view and a 40-minute tunnel ride, we finally reached the summit, affectionately known as the ‘Top of Europe.’ The views were stunning, much like Mount Titlis, just from a slightly higher perch. So, basically, the same epic scenery, just with a bit more altitude, more tunnels and a lot more tourists! Jungfraubahn Jungfrau – Top of Europe VIDEO Jungfraujoch, Switzerland train journey Unlike Mount Titlis, Jungfraujoch didn’t have much going on except a short stroll in the snow. And boy, was it crowded! Indians, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists were everywhere, making it impossible to snap a clean pic without someone photobombing. For me, it was a dud experience, probably because I had sky-high expectations. Note to self: sometimes the hype is just that—a hype! Cog Rail Approaching the Top of Europe Scenic train ride Grindelwald , Switzerland By noon, we decided to make our exit from Jungfraujoch. This time, we mixed things up by taking the train down to Eigergletscher and then hopping onto a cable car to Grindelwald. This ropeway ride offered some of the best views of the Swiss Alps and meadows. Even after 35 minutes, I was left craving for more! This was the best scenic detour I had taken in Switzerland! Staubbach Waterfall, Lauterbrunnen , Switzerland From Grindelwald, we hopped onto a train to Lauterbrunnen via Zweilütschinen. As soon as we arrived, the famous Staubbach Falls beckoned, just a short kilometer from the train station. But, our stomachs had other plans—they growled louder than the waterfall! Unanimously, we agreed that food comes before falls. So, we dashed into Food Point Kebap, where heavenly pizzas and shawarmas awaited. After devouring our meal, we strolled leisurely towards the falls, bellies full and spirits high. Staubbach Waterfall, Lauterbrunnen Staubbach Waterfall is Switzerland’s grandest spectacle, a dramatic stage show featuring a spectacular performance of liquid art. Every drop plays its part in a symphony of splashes and sprays, glittering like diamonds in the sunlight. It’s a natural reminder that amidst our busy, tech-obsessed lives, there’s a wild, untamed world out there that’s stunningly beautiful. Once again, my gadgets went berserk and I clicked around 100 pics at this place alone. VIDEO Staubbach Waterfall, Lauterbrunnen Back to Wengen While walking back towards Lauterbrunnen train station for a train to Wengen, we did some grocery shopping at Coop store , located just opposite to the station. By the time we reached Wengen, the town had rolled up its sidewalks, leaving us to dine on our humble provisions. After a simple dinner, it was time to sleep and dream about the next day’s visit to Zermatt and Matterhorn. Wengen Day 7 (17-Jun-2024) – Zermatt & Matterhorn Toblerone is hands down one of my all-time favorite chocolates. Have you ever taken a closer look at its packaging? There’s a mountain on it, and that peak is none other than the mighty Matterhorn. So, today we had plans to explore this place. The route we had chalked out was Wengen – Lauterbrunnen – Interlaken – Spiez – Visp – Zermatt – Matterhorn The pic I had in my mind And what a disaster I clicked… Zermatt , Switzerland The total journey till Zermatt was for about 3 hrs one way, featuring four thrilling train changeovers. Luckily, we were traveling light—no luggage to slow us down. We reached Zermatt by 11am. It is a small town surrounded by mountains and famous for skiing. From outside the train station we boarded bus no. 571 which took us to the base of cable car for Matterhorn, from where the real adventure began! Zermatt Town Matterhorn Gandola Ride There were three cable cars to be taken. The first gondola whisked us up to Furi at 1640 meters, offering a spectacular bird’s eye view of Zermatt village below. Next, we hopped on the second gondola, climbing from Furi to Trockener Steg at 2939 meters, soaring over a rugged, rocky alpine wonderland. The grand finale? The third gondola, taking us from Trockener Steg to Klein Matterhorn, also known as Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. Matterhorn Gandola Matterhorn Summit The views from the 360-degree panorama platform at Matterhorn Glacier Paradise were absolutely jaw-dropping. Snow-covered mountains and glaciers stretched as far as the eye could see. This spot, the highest viewing platform in Europe, gave us a front-row seat to the awe-inspiring grandeur of Mother Nature. This was similar to our experience at Gulmarg, Kashmir , in India. VIDEO Matterhorn However, as we bravely stepped out onto the platform for that full-circle view, we were hit by a cold so fierce it felt like nature’s version of a slap in the face. The snow-laden wind gave us a frosty slap in the face, making it a Herculean effort to stay out there. Despite the bone-chilling cold, we managed to snap some quick pics, capturing our frosty Narnia-like surroundings and, of course, striking the classic Toblerone pose. We barely lasted ten minutes before the icy wind sent us scurrying back to warmth! Matterhorn Top The Ice Palace The ice palace is like stepping into an icy wonderland of Switzerland, packed with stunning ice sculptures and ancient ice formations. It’s so cool, it feels like you’re in a magical ice kingdom! The soft lighting and chill music create a super soothing vibe. The Cinema Lounge Europe’s highest cinema, the Cinema Lounge, is hidden in the Breithorn tunnel at Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. They show short films that are a few minutes long, covering everything from mountaineering and local wildlife to the history of the cable car and fun ice and snow facts. It’s like Netflix, but way cooler—literally! Matterhorn was the most windy and chilly place on this entire trip. It was nature’s way of telling us, “Hey, did you bring your thermals?” Finally, we left Matterhorn around 13.00 hrs and reached Interlaken by 15.30 hrs. Interlaken and Harder Kulm , Switzerland Since we arrived in Interlaken earlier than expected, we decided to check out Harder Kulm, the city’s highest point with killer views. But oh no, the queue for the inclined train was a real Bollywood drama, with everyone pushing and jostling like it was the last train out of town. And when we finally reached the top, it was more crowded than a Mumbai local during rush hour. View from Harder Kulm View from Harder Kulm After a bit of exploring and a delicious dinner at India Village Restaurant in Interlaken, we made our triumphant return to Wengen by 20:00 hrs. VIDEO Interlaken Day 8 (18-Jun-2024) – Grindelwald and Interlaken Today’s plan was a hiking trail to Lake Bachalpsee from Grindelwald First. First things first: we had to get to Grindelwald. My mother, clearly not a fan of mountain hiking, chose to stay back and rest. So, we set off at 7:00 am, leaving the apartment, boarding the train to Lauterbrunnen, hopping off at Zweilütschinen, and then catching the train to Grindelwald. From there, a quick bus ride whisked us to the cable car station for Grindelwald. Grindelwald First Grindelwald First Ride options Before boarding the gondola, we had to navigate a maze of ticket options. First up was the First Flyer, a thrilling ride where up to four people zip along an 800-meter steel cable from First to Schreckfeld at a heart-pounding 84 km/h. Not adrenaline-pumping enough? Enter the First Glider, where four persons can soar through the mountain landscape like eagles. First, it pulls you backward from Schreckfeld to First at 72 km/h. Then, on the return journey, you reach a dizzying speed of 83 km/h. Choices galore! Amidst the lineup of thrilling options, there was the Mountain Cart, barreling safely down a 3 km road on the mountain. Then, there was the Trottibike Scooter, a curious hybrid of scooter and bike that zooms from Bort to Grindelwald, breezing past flower meadows and farmhouses with ease. As we pondered our choices, the queue for the first three activities stretched to a mind-numbing 150 minutes. It was a no-brainer: Trottibike Scooter, here we come! Grindelwald First Grindelwald First Summit The Gandola journey whisked us to the summit in a brisk 15 minutes. The view of the meadows was absolutely breathtaking, one of the finest we’d seen in the past few days. Next, an exhilaratingly long cliff-side walk, with the wind in our hair and the sound of the waterfall below, awaited us. VIDEO Grindelwald First Cliff Walk Despite packing our ‘vacationsnippets’ tees for the trip, the chilly weather prevented us from wearing them until today. Finally, we seized the opportunity to showcase and promote our page by donning those tees and snapping some pics. vacationsnippets Trottibike Scooter Ride We had grand plans to hike to Lake Bachalpsee, but my right foot decided to develop a corn and protest against long walks, so we scrapped that idea and made a beeline for the Trottibike Scooter Point instead. Before they entrusted us with the scooters, we were handed an indemnity form. It was a moment of truth as we each took a pen and signed our names on the dotted lines, accepting the responsibility for our adventure. It sounded just like a medical consent for before the surgery. Grudgingly, we scribbled our names on the dotted lines for all three of us. Helmets and scooters were then doled out, with a lightning-fast crash course on mastering the art of using both brakes simultaneously. As we started rolling down the inclined road, I realized the scooter had no seat to sit on. It wasn’t easy to stand and balance the scooter. ‘What the heck?’ I mumbled. Meanwhile, my kid and wife effortlessly found their groove and zoomed ahead while I lagged behind, still trying to figure out the whole standing-and-scooting thing. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but soon enough, I was cruising confidently, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. The scenery was truly breathtaking—rolling green meadows, vibrant flowers, majestic mountains as our backdrop, and a smooth asphalt path beneath our wheels. Pure bliss, even if my scooter seemed intent on setting a new land speed record downhill! Trottibike Experience Trottibike Scooter Mishap As I zoomed ahead on the scooter, overtaking first my wife and then my kid, the thrill of the ride took me back to carefree childhood days in Kanpur. Memories flooded back from 1995, when I was my kid’s age, biking around town without a care in the world. But just as I was nostalgic, I realized I had left those times far behind. Parking my scooter, I waited, reminiscing about those innocent days of cycling to tuition classes. Suddenly, I spotted them approaching, and I couldn’t help but notice my son’s torn jeans. Apparently, he had taken a tumble along the way, ending up with a bruised knee. Despite his attempts to brush it off, I knew it stung and pained badly. From then on, we rolled more cautiously, eventually returning to the base station. Returning the scooter, we hurried to the nearby Coop pharmacy for antibiotic spray and bandages. Back at our Wengen apartment, we tended to his injury. I worried he might struggle to walk comfortably, but to my relief, he not only walked without a limp but was already planning our next adventure. Schynige Platte , Switzerland With my mom finally joining us now in second half, we embarked on a quirky journey to Schynige Platte, just an hour’s train ride from Wilderswil, which was around 45 mins from Wengen. Thanks to our Swiss pass, we snagged a sweet 50% discount on the tickets, making the journey even more thrilling. The Schynige Platte-Bahn, born way back in 1893, rattled and climbed its way up from Wilderswil, treating us to breathtaking views along its 7.3 km rack-and-pinion railway route, ascending a whopping 1420 meters. Schynige Platte Arriving in the evening meant our return train was the last train out, set to chug away in just an hour. As we meandered toward a viewpoint, we stumbled upon a pipe-shaped slide that unexpectedly awakened our inner children! Resistance was futile—we gleefully spent the next 20 minutes zipping down the slide and another 20 snapping pics of jaw-dropping scenery that could rival a postcard. View from Schynige Platte By the time we realized we had to walk to the other side of the mountain, the clock was ticking louder than a Swiss watch. Missing that train for the view? Unthinkable! The ride back to Wilderswil was smooth sailing, albeit uneventful. From there, it was a quick hop onto the next train to Lauterbrunnen and then finally back to Wengen. And just like that, our Swiss escapade wrapped up with this delightful attraction. Check out from our pad and jet back to Zurich for the homeward-bound flight to India. With dreams of Shahrukh-Kajol Switzerland dancing in my head, I drifted off to sleep. VIDEO Schynige Platte train journey, Switzerland Day 9 (19-Jun-2024) – Cruise at Lake Brienz, visit to Lindt Chocolate Home and return flight I woke up before the crack of dawn, determined to squeeze every last drop out of my final day in Switzerland. Stumbling out of bed, I grabbed my trusty DSLR and ventured out for a brisk morning walk to capture the early moments when Switzerland was still snoring away. A quiet morning at Wengen By the time I got back, everyone was awake and getting ready, doing last minute of packing. We gobbled our breakfast, stashed the garbage in the bin, dropped the keys at the tourist center, and hopped on the train to Interlaken via Lauterbrunnen. Lake Brienz Boat Tour At the Interlaken train station, we embarked on the great quest for an XL luggage locker. Alas, our hopes were dashed, so we settled for two large lockers and shoved our luggage in it. Next, with just a few handbags we boarded a cruise ship on Lake Brienz. The boat was packed, and with the sun beating down on us, it felt like we’d signed up for a free sauna session. But as soon as the cruise started, a refreshing breeze from the lake kissed our faces, and we were in heaven. The boat chugged along at a leisurely pace, and we soaked in the gorgeous shoreline scenery, feeling like we were starring in our own travel documentary. The cruise dropped us off near Brienz train station, and after a delightful little stroll along the shore, we hopped back on the train to Interlaken. Our day felt like a blend of mild chaos and magical moments. Lake Brienz with beer Last minute plan change – Lindt Home of Chocolate We retrieved our luggage from the lockers and boarded the train to Zurich HB via Luzern. As we chugged along, my son suddenly expressed his desire to visit the Lindt Home of Chocolate . With our ETA at Zurich being 17:00 and our flight at 22:20, we calculated that we had a couple of hours to spare. We decided to take this calculated risk as we knew we might not visit Switzerland again. At Zurich HB, we embarked on yet another epic quest for an XL locker. This time, fortune smiled upon us, and we found one! With our bags safely stashed away, we were ready to make a mad dash for chocolate heaven, knowing this might be our only shot at such a ‘sweet’ adventure. Lindt Lindt Home of Chocolate We took the next train to Kilchberg from where Lindt Home of Chocolate was ten mins by walk. We reached there by 17.50 hrs. The place had a wonderful setup of how chocolates are made, right from cocoa selection, grinding, quality checks and even offered complimentary chocolate tasting. By the time we were done, it was around 18.20 hrs. We hurried back to Kilchberg train station and boarded the train to Zurich HB. Again, we sprinted to retrieve our bags from the locker and then boarded our final train to Zurich airport. We finally reached the airport by 19.10 hrs, right on time. The gamble to visit Lindt Home of Chocolate had paid off. Zurich – Dubai – New Delhi The return flight from Zurich departed on time and reached Dubai the next morning. After a short wait, we again boarded the next flight to Delhi and reached home by evening. Zurich Airport Our trip to Switzerland was a fantastic experience. From the stunning landscapes to the majestic snowy Alps, every moment was packed with wonder and excitement. It was a different experience for me as I usually prefer road trip , and this one was a mix of all transports, other than cars . This trip is the one we’ll always cherish, especially since it was my first overseas holiday with my mother. I hope it holds a special place in her heart, too.
