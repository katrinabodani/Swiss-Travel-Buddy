Switzerland’s diverse landscapes bring a mix of weather conditions that can change quickly, even within a single day. Whether you’re exploring the cities, hiking in the Alps or taking a scenic train ride , being prepared for Switzerland’s climate will help you make the most of your trip. The climate in Switzerland Switzerland has a temperate climate, but its weather varies greatly depending on altitude and region. The lowland areas , including cities like Zurich, Geneva and Bern, experience four distinct seasons with mild summers and cold winters. In contrast, the Alps have a more extreme climate, with heavy snowfall in winter and cooler temperatures year-round. Spring (March to May) Spring in Switzerland sees a gradual rise in temperatures and the return of greenery. In the lowlands, temperatures range from 8°C to 15°C, while the mountains remain colder. Spring is an excellent time for city trips and lower-altitude hikes, though higher-altitude trails may still be covered in snow until late May or even well into June. Spring is a beautiful season When everything comes back to life after a cold winter Summer (June to August) Summer is warm and sometimes even hot (for Swiss standards). Temperatures in the cities average around 18°C to 30°C. While we don't get those crazy summers like countries like Australia or Egypt do, it's still not uncommon for temperatures to rise up to 38°C and stay well over 30°C for two to three weeks in lower regions in the middle of summer. It’s the best time for outdoor activities like hiking, swimming in lakes and enjoying Switzerland’s many festivals. However, the mountains offer a cooler escape, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C. Thunderstorms are common in summer, especially in the afternoons, so carrying a light rain jacket is advisable. Summer is the perfect sesason to go hiking. Or to take a refreshing dip in a mountain lake... Autumn (September to November) Autumn brings colourful landscapes, cooler temperatures and fewer crowds. September is still warm, but by November, temperatures can drop to single digits. It’s a great season for hiking, as many trails are still accessible before the first heavy snowfall. Wine regions like Lavaux and Valais are particularly beautiful at this time of year. And let's not forget the golden forests in the Engadine. There's just nothing like it... Autumn is one of my favourite seasons beacause temperatures are lower... ... and the trees turn red, yellow and orange. Winter (December to February) Winter in Switzerland is all about snow sports, Christmas markets and cosy mountain chalets. The lowlands see temperatures between -2°C and 7°C, while mountain regions are much colder. Ski resorts open from late November and stay busy until April. Even if you’re not into skiing, winter train rides and visits to snow-covered villages offer a magical experience. Winter is best spent up in the mountains The steepest funicular railway in the world on its route to the mountain station in winter. Regional differences in weather The Alps have higher elevations, which means colder temperatures and more precipitation, especially in winter. Some areas receive over 10 metres of snow annually. The Plateau, which includes major cities, has moderate temperatures but can experience fog during autumn and winter. In contrast, Ticino in the south enjoys a Mediterranean climate with warmer temperatures and more sunshine, making it a great destination for those seeking milder winters.
