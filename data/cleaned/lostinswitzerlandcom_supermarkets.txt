Migros is the largest supermarket chain in Switzerland. They sell everything from packaged food to fresh produce, staple foods, drinks, pre-cooked meals, desserts , toiletries, confectionery and clothesâ€¦ You name it. However, if you're looking for alcohol or cigarettes, your endeavours will fail. When Migros was established back in 1925, its founder set an example to support public health by banning alcohol and cigarettes from his stores. 100 years later, his legacy still lives on. If youâ€™re trying to save money , look for M-Budget , the Migros low-price home brand. They create their own version of pretty much every product imaginable. Be that spaghetti, cheese , chocolate , desserts, gummy bears, canned food, tomato sauce, meat, shampoo, potato peelers or even cotton buds. You'd be surprised at how tasty the 1.20 CHF M-Budget chocolate actually is... ðŸ™‚
