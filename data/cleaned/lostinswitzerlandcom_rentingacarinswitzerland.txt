Getting around Switzerland is easy. Whether you’re using public transport or renting a car: you will have no issues travelling from one place to another. It all depends on your preferences and your travel plans. While Switzerland’s public transport system is one of the best in the world, having your own set and planning a road trip of wheels definitely has its upsides. You can venture off the beaten track , stop at your favourite photo spot and make spontaneous detours whenever you like. That said, renting a car in Switzerland comes with its own set of considerations. In this guide, I’ll cover practical tips for renting a car, a breakdown of costs you can expect, important things to keep in mind on the road, the best places to rent a car and much more. Ready to dive in? Then buckle up… Renting a car vs. travelling by public transport Switzerland’s public transport system is world-class. With punctual trains, scenic railway routes and well-connected buses, you can easily get to most places without your own vehicle. But does that mean renting a car isn’t worth it? Not necessarily. It all depends on your preferences. Here’s a quick comparison to help you decide what’s best for your trip. When renting a car is a better option If you want to explore remote villages, mountain passes or less touristy areas , a car gives you the freedom to go beyond train routes. If you’re planning a scenic road trip in a group or as a family , a car can be cost-effective when splitting expenses compared to multiple train tickets. If you prefer a flexible schedule , a rental car allows you to stop at viewpoints, take detours or visit places off the beaten path without being bound by timetables. Venturing to remote places... ... is a lot easier with your rental car. When to choose public transport Travelling by public transport is the way to go if you plan on sticking to major cities and tourist hubs like Zurich , Geneva, Lucerne, Interlaken or Zermatt. Cities have excellent tram, bus and train networks that make it easy to get around. Also, driving and parking in city centres can be a hassle and expensive. If you’re planning on travelling on scenic trains like the Glacier Express, Bernina Express or the GoldenPass Line, then don’t bother renting a car. Just grab your ticket or travel pass and enjoy the view without worrying about traffic. If you travel on your own or with one other person , catching a train might be cheaper than renting a car. If you plan on catching a panoramic train like the Glacier Express... ... or the Bernina Express, public transport is the way to go. Ultimately, both options have their advantages and it really depends on what you prefer. Either way, I don’t think you can go wrong. But since we’re talking about renting a car in Switzerland here, let’s assume you’re choosing a car over public transort Practical tips for renting a car in Switzerland To ensure a hassle-free experience, there are a few practical tips to keep in mind when renting a car in Switzerland. Book early : Rental cars can be in high demand, especially in summer or over the school holidays. Booking a few months in advance often gets you a better rate. Compare prices : Use comparison sites to check prices across companies. You’ll often save money this way. I’ll tell you more on using DiscoverCars later, which makes comparing deals super easy. Have a credit card ready: Swiss rental companies require a credit card in the driver’s name for the security deposit. Debit cards usually won’t cut it. The rental agency will place a hold on your card - often between 1000 to 3000 CHF - as a deposit, so ensure your credit limit can handle it. Take note of age restrictions: Please note that the driver typically needs to be at least 21 years old, or 25 for some car categories, and have a valid driver’s license. An International Driving Permit is recommended if your license isn’t from Europe. Choose the right car for your trip: Switzerland has everything from narrow city streets to high Alpine passes, so pick a car that fits your plans. For city-hopping, a small compact car is easier to park and more fuel-efficient. If you’re heading into the mountains or travelling in winter, consider a 4WD or a car with a bit more power. An SUV can be helpful for snowy areas or steep inclines, but note that larger vehicles will use more fuel and might be harder to navigate on tight mountain roads. Automatic vs. manual: Manual transmission cars are common and often cheaper, but if you only drive automatics, reserve an automatic well in advance. They cost around 10 CHF more per day on average. Plan for winter driving (if applicable): Switzerland has four distinct seasons . If you’re visiting in winter or early spring, ensure your rental car comes equipped with winter tires. Many Swiss rentals have them in winter by default. While winter tires aren’t legally mandatory in Switzerland, they are highly recommended for safety . Carry snow chains if you plan to drive through high mountain passes. Some roads will have signs requiring chains in heavy snow. Check the weather conditions: Before driving into the Alps, always check the weather conditions. Don’t be fooled by what things look like around your current location. A sunny valley can turn into a snowy mountain in a short drive. Know what's included (and what's not): Before you drive off, double-check what is included in your rental rate. Most rentals include unlimited mileage and basic mandatory liability insurance. Collision damage waiver (CDW) coverage might be included with a deductible (excess), or it might be an add-on. Know your coverage to avoid surprises. Also, inspect the car for any existing scratches or dents and ensure they’re noted on the contract to avoid disputes when you return the car. Cost breakdown: Rental prices, fuel, insurance and fees Renting a car in Switzerland is not the cheapest way to get around , but if you budget wisely, it can be worth every buck for the freedom it provides. Here’s a breakdown of the typical costs you should account for. Rental rates The daily price of the car itself will likely be your biggest expense. Costs vary by car size, location and season. For a small economy car, you might pay around 30 to 65 CHF per day in base rental rate, whereas a midsize sedan can be around 70 to 120 CHF per day. Luxury vehicles or SUVs can range anywhere from 150 up to 200+ CHF per day in high season. Prices in peak summer (July-August) are highest, while in off-season months you could find rates 20 to 30% lower. One-way rentals , where you pick up your car in one city and drop it off in another, often incur an extra fee. Sometimes around 50 to 100 CHF within Switzerland, more if cross-border. Also note, airport rentals might include a slight surcharge, around 10 to 15 CHF extra for the convenience. Car Rental - Search, Compare and Save up to 70%! ✓ No Hidden Costs ✓ 24/7 Support ✓ Free Cancellation Fuel Fuel in Switzerland is sold by the liter and is relatively expensive compared to many countries. Prices vary, but expect to pay around 1.60 CHF to 2.10 CHF per liter. Diesel is usually priced a tad higher than «regular» fuel. When planning a road trip, factor in how many kilometres you’ll drive and your car’s fuel consumption. Most rental cars in Switzerland are quite fuel-efficient, especially diesel engines common in Europe. Also note that most rentals come with a full-to-full fuel policy . You receive the car with a full tank and you must return it full to avoid steep refueling charges. Tips so save moeny on fuel : Avoid gas stations on highways or pass roads, as those are significantly more expensive. If you fuel up at stations that aren't services, i.e. don't have a shop, you also get cheaper rates. you can fill up at major supermarkets or outside city centers where prices tend to be a bit lower. Insurance Basic liability insurance is included in Swiss rental prices by law, covering damage to others. However, collision and theft coverage usually come with a deductible. For example, you might be responsible for the first 1000 to 2000 CHF of the damage, while the insurance pays the rest. To reduce your liability, you have a few options: Buy the rental company’s Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or a super CDW that brings your deductible to zero Use a third-party insurance Or rely on a credit card’s car rental coverage (if applicable) Purchasing CDW from the rental company can cost roughly 15 to 30 CHF per day extra to cut down your excess. Please note that this varies by car class . Full coverage will cost more, sometimes pushing your daily rate up significantly. It’s worth doing the math: in some cases, an independent policy or the coverage offered via a booking platform can be much cheaper. For instance, DiscoverCars offers a full coverage insurance option for about 7 CHF per day, which can be a great deal compared to what you’d pay at the counter. Whichever route you choose, make sure you’re comfortable with the level of coverage. Repairs in Switzerland are pricey, so having insurance can save you a huge headache. Let's hope you don't end up in an accident. But in case you do, it's advisable to have a good insurance. Additional fees and extras Be sure to budget for any extras you might need. Common additional fees include: GPS navigation unit child car seats additional driver fees young driver surcharges A GPS or child seat might add CHF 10 to 15 CHF per day each. You can often bring your own child seat to save money and using your smartphone for navigation is a free alternative to renting a GPS. Adding an additional driver can cost roughly 5 to 10 CHF per day, unless you snag a deal where spouses or one extra driver is included. Drivers under 25 years old may be charged a young driver fee or be limited to certain car categories. Also, if you plan to drive the car outside of Switzerland , check with the rental company in advance. Some may charge a cross-border fee or have restrictions on taking the car into certain countries. Lastly, parking tickets, speeding fines and traffic violations will also hit your wallet. The rental company will forward any fines to you, often with an added admin fee, so drive carefully to avoid those extra costs! Adding a GPS can sometimes cost extra As does adding an extra driver to your contract Always read the rental agreement’s fine print so you’re aware of all potential fees. Switzerland also has an 8.1% VAT that typically is included in the quoted price, but some locations may add surcharges. In total, taxes and location fees can add around 15 to 25% on top of the base rate. So the initial price you see might increase once all fees are tallied. Knowing all these costs upfront will help you budget better for your trip. Important things to keep in mind Driving in Switzerland is generally a pleasure. The roads are in excellent condition and the scenery is amazing . But it’s important to know the local traffic rules and conventions. Here are some key things to keep in mind when you hit the Swiss roads: Drive on the right In Switzerland, as in most of continental Europe, you drive on the r ight-hand side of the road . If you’re coming from the UK, Australia or other left-driving countries, take some time to adjust. The driver’s seat is on the left side of the car. It sounds basic, but in moments of distraction, you want to remember to stay on the right. Also, seat belts are mandatory for all passengers and children must be in appropriate car seats . On Swiss roads... ... you have to drive on the right-hand side. Speed limits & traffic cameras Speed limits are strictly enforced . The typical limits are 120 km/h on highways, 80 km/h on rural roads and 50 km/h in urban areas, unless signs state otherwise. In many residential areas, you’ll even find 30 km/h or 20 km/h zones. Switzerland has an extensive network of speed cameras (both fixed and mobile), and fines for speeding are hefty . Driving 56 km/h instead of 50 km/h in urban areas costs 120 CHF! It’s not just a slap on the wrist. Extreme speeding can even get you in legal trouble. So, enjoy the drive but keep an eye on those speed signs. Stick to the speed limit Not doing so can get really expensive Traffic rules & etiquette Swiss driving rules are similar to those in the rest of Western Europe. At intersections or roundabouts, yield to vehicles coming from your right , unless there’s a stop/yield sign or traffic light indicating otherwise. On mountain roads, vehicles going uphill have the right of way over those coming down, since it’s harder to regain momentum uphill. It’s common courtesy, and sometimes necessary due to narrow roads, for the downhill car to pull over at a wider spot to let the uphill car pass. And one more important rule: no right turn on red . Unlike in the US, you must wait for the green light. Drinking and driving Friendly piece of advice: just don’t do it . It’s not worth it. Switzerland has a low blood alcohol limit. The legal limit is 0.05% BAC , which is about one small beer or a glass of wine, depending on your body weight. For new drivers with under 3 years of license, it’s even stricter at 0.01%. Penalties for DUI are severe and there are frequent checks. It’s best to play it safe and designate a driver or avoid alcohol entirely if you’ll be driving. Highway vignette (toll sticker) Switzerland doesn’t have toll booths on its highways like France or Italy. Instead, it uses a vignette system . Any car driving on Swiss motorways must have a vignette (a sticker on the windshield) indicating you’ve paid the annual highway fee. The vignette costs CHF 40 and is valid for the calendar year. Actually it covers December of the previous year through January of the next. The good news is all Swiss rental cars should already have a valid vignette on the windshield, since it’s required. It’s worth double-checking when you pick up your car, though. Look for a small sticker on the windshield, usually near the rear-view mirror or corner. It shows the last two digits of the current year. So 25 at the point of writing this article. You need a Swiss Vignette to drive on Swiss highways. They cost 40 CHF but Swiss rental cars usually alredy have one. If by some chance your rental car doesn’t have one, you can buy one at gas stations, post offices or border crossings. Driving on a highway without a vignette will result in a hefty fine if you get caught. Once you have the vignette, you can use all the highways with no extra charges , except for a couple of very specific tunnels (like the Great St. Bernard Tunnel to Italy) which have separate tolls. But for most travellers sticking to Swiss roads, there’s nothing else to pay beyond that vignette. Parking Parking rules in Swiss towns can be a little confusing at first, but they’re manageable once you know the system. Many areas use a color-coded zone system. Blue zones are common in city centers. These allow free parking for a short duration, typically up to 1 hour, during the day. But you must display a blue parking disc on your dashboard showing your arrival time. If you rent a car, ask if a parking disc is provided or pick one up cheaply at a gas station or tourist office. Blue zone timings are usually Monday to Saturday during business hours, usually from 8:00 to 19:00. Outside of those times you might be able to park longer, even overnight, for free. Always check the signs. Blue zones are indicated with the blue P-sign you see in the picture. They're very common in housing areas in cities. White zones generally indicate paid parking. Either a meter or pay-and-display ticket machine will be nearby. Pay for the time you need and clearly display the ticket on the dash. White zones are always accompanied by a parking metre. You can either pay with cash or with your phone through the EasyPark app. Yellow zones are typically private or reserved. Do not park in yellow zones, they are for permit holders like residents or businesses and unauthorized cars will be fined or towed. Yellow zones are off limits as they are private Sometimes you'll find them right next to white zones In addition to street parking, all cities and large towns have parking garages. Look for signs with a white “P” on a blue background. These garages are often the easiest option – albeit not cheap. Rates can be around 2 to 4 CHF per hour or more in cities. Every city has several parking garages. Some even have dynamic displays telling you if they're full or how many free spots are still available. When parking anywhere, be sure you’re not in a spot that’s reserved or requires a permit. Fines for illegal parking will find their way to you via the rental company, with an extra admin fee on top. Fueling up & gas stations Fuel stations are plentiful, especially along highways and in towns. Highways have rest stops with gas, restaurants and restrooms at regular intervals. Most stations are self-service . You pump first, then pay at the cashier or card machine. Many have 24/7 automatic pumps where you can pay by card. Make sure your credit card has a PIN, as automated machines sometimes ask for one. Unleaded petrol is “95” or “98” octane (labeled as such), and diesel is usually labeled “Diesel” or sometimes “Gazole”. By the way, Sunday in Switzerland can feel like everything’s closed, but larger gas stations (especially on highways) remain open and often have mini-marts where you can grab snacks or even basic groceries. So if you’re in need of a supermarket and everything is closed, gas stations are your go-to place. You find gas stations all over the place. Non-serviced ones are cheaper than serviced ones. Navigation & road signs Switzerland’s road signage is very clear. Major destinations are signposted in green for highways (Autobahn) and blue for main or secondary roads . Tourist attractions might be signposted in brown . A GPS or map app will serve you well, but also pay attention to road signs. It’s a good idea to have an offline map as backup in case you lose signal in the mountains. Additionally, note that the default GPS route might take you the fastest way – which could be through pricey tunnels or even car-train tunnels where you load your car onto a train to go through a mountain. It’s usually fine, but if you’re trying to avoid extra costs or want a more scenic above-ground route, double-check the suggested route. Blue signs indicate main streets While green signs point to highways Emergency and safety In case of an emergency, the Swiss emergency number for police is 117, ambulance 144 and fire 118 . 112 works as a general European emergency number as well. Carrying a warning triangle in the car is required and should be provided by the rental. If you have a breakdown on the highway, you’re supposed to put on a high-visibility safety vest (many cars have one in the glovebox) and set up the warning triangle behind the car. The main automobile club in Switzerland is TCS (Touring Club Schweiz). If you have AAA (USA) or CAA (Canada) or similar, check if they have reciprocal agreements for roadside assistance in Switzerland. Generally, rentals will provide you a number to call for their own roadside help if needed. Border crossings Switzerland is not in the EU , but in the Schengen zone. If you plan to drive into neighboring countries like France, Italy, Germany, Austria or Liechtenstein, you usually can. But inform the rental company when booking. Most rentals allow it, but some high-end cars might be restricted. Each neighboring country has its own toll. The Swiss vignette doesn’t cover foreign highways and vice versa . If you drive into Italy or France, be prepared to pay tolls at the booths. If you pop into Austria, you’ll need to buy an Austrian vignette, even for a short visit. Crossing borders is usually straightforward. Often there’s no stop at all, just a sign. But occasionally there may be spot checks, so have your passport and rental documents with you. And of course, make sure you meet the driving rules of the country you enter. As long as you plan ahead, cross-border trips from Switzerland are easy and a great way to expand your travel. Just remember to purchase any needed vignettes and watch for different road signs. Crossing borders in Europe is pretty straightforward. Make sure you still bring your documents with you, though. Best places to rent a car in Switzerland Switzerland offers many convenient locations to pick up a rental car. Here are some of the best places and ways to rent a car in the country: Zurich Airport Zurich’s international airport is the busiest in Switzerland. It’s also one of the most convenient places to rent a car. All the major rental companies like Europcar, Hertz, Sixt, Avis, Budget, etc. have desks at Zurich Airport. After you clear customs, you can follow signs to the car rental centre and usually be on the road within minutes. Renting at the airport is perfect if you’re flying into Switzerland and want to start your road trip immediately. Please note that some airports include a small premium fee for on-site rentals, but the ease of picking up right after a flight often outweighs this. From Zurich Airport, you’re directly connected to highways that can take you toward Zurich city , north to Germany, or south toward Lucerne and the Alps. Airports are a very convenient place to pick up your rental. Zurich Airport is Switzerland's biggest airport and has lots of rental options. Geneva Airport Geneva Airport is another popular pick-up spot, especially for travellers exploring the French-speaking part of Switzerland or even hopping over to France. Unique to Geneva Airport is that it has two sides : a Swiss side and a French side. You can rent a car from either, but if your trip is mainly in Switzerland, rent from the Swiss side. A car rented on the Swiss side will come with the Swiss highway vignette and typically the equipment needed for Swiss roads, like winter tires. People sometimes try renting on the French side as prices can be lower, but then you’ll have to immediately buy a Swiss vignette and make sure you can even get to Swiss roads without accidentally taking a vignette-required route. It can be more hassle than it’s worth unless you have a specific plan. Geneva Airport’s rental desks are well-organized and you can easily drive into Geneva city (15 minutes) or head east along Lake Geneva towards Montreux or south into the Alps. Basel Airport (EuroAirport) Basel’s EuroAirport is interesting because it’s shared by Switzerland and France and very close to Germany. Like Geneva, it has a French sector and a Swiss sector. If you’re primarily visiting Switzerland, rent from the Swiss sector. If you have a multi-country trip including France or Germany, you might compare prices, but remember the vignette issue if you go Swiss highways. Basel itself is a great starting point if you plan to explore northern Switzerland or drive into the Black Forest region of Germany or Alsace in France. Major rental companies operate here as well. Basel Airport is also super handy for a car pickup. It's perfect for your trip to Switzerland, France or Germany Bern Airport and other regional airports Bern has a small regional airport with a few car rental options. There are also car rental services at Lugano Airport (Ticino) and St. Gallen-Altenrhein in the northeast. However, these airports are much smaller and not as commonly used by international tourists. If you fly into a regional airport or arrive by private aviation, you can certainly rent from there, but the selection might be more limited and possibly pricier due to less competition. City centre locations If you’re already in a city and decide you need a car, you can rent from downtown locations . All major cities like Zurich , Geneva, Basel, Bern, Lucerne , Lausanne, etc. have rental offices, often near the main train stations. For example, Zurich has several downtown rental branches, including one at Zurich Hauptbahnhof – the main railway station. Geneva has offices around the central station Gare Cornavin and elsewhere in the city. Renting in the city can be useful if you don’t want a car for your whole trip. For instance, you could enjoy a few days in Zurich using public transport, then pick up a car in the city to head out to the countryside. One thing to consider: downtown locations may have shorter opening hours than airports, which often have 24/7 or late-night service. Always check the pickup and drop-off times and whether the office is open on Sundays. Many are closed on Sunday in Switzerland or have very limited hours. Train station pick-ups As mentioned, train stations are common locations for rental agencies. Zurich main station, Geneva Cornavin, Basel SBB, Lausanne, etc. often have rental kiosks or offices either in the station or a short walk away. This is super convenient if you’re coming in by train from another country or another Swiss city and want to transition to driving. You can often coordinate a one-way rental easily between train station locations and airports. Cities like Zurich have lots of car rental places nearby. They're very easy to reach if you arrive in a city by public transport. One-way rentals within Switzerland It’s worth noting that many companies allow one-way rentals within Switzerland. This can be a great option for itineraries like arriving in Zurich, doing a road trip through the country and flying out of Geneva. There’s usually an extra fee for this, but it might not be exorbitant within the same country. Always ask or check the terms when booking. One-way international rentals, as in dropping the car in a different country, can incur very high fees. It’s often cheaper to keep your rental within Switzerland and return it there. Local agencies In addition to the big international brands, Switzerland has some local car rental companies or dealers that rent cars. These might sometimes have better prices for specific needs, like a luxury car or a camper van. However, using the well-known agencies or a comparison site tends to be more straightforward for most travellers and you’ll have the backing of a larger company if anything goes wrong. Using DiscoverCars for your Switzerland car rental When it comes to finding a great deal and simplifying the rental process, DiscoverCars is a resource that many travellers to Switzerland swear by. DiscoverCars is an online platform that compares rental car prices across numerous companies. Think of it as the Booking.com of rental cars . Instead of checking each rental agency one by one, DiscoverCars lets you enter your dates and locations and then shows you offerings from big international brands (like Hertz, Avis, Europcar, Sixt, Budget) as well as smaller local agencies, all in one search. DiscoverCars helps you find the best deal for your roadtrip through Switzerland. Why consider using DiscoverCars for renting a car in Switzerland? First off, it often helps you find a cheaper rate than booking directly. The platform negotiates attractive deals and bulk rates for its customers. The site also makes it easy to filter results : you can specify automatic or manual, choose the car size or type and add things like an additional driver or GPS, to see the true cost upfront. DiscoverCars clearly breaks down the price including estimated taxes and fees so you know what you’re looking at. Another advantage is the flexibility and customer service that comes with DiscoverCars. Most bookings through them come with free cancellation up to 48 hours before pick-up, which gives you peace of mind in case plans change. At checkout, DiscoverCars offers a full coverage insurance option . As mentioned earlier, for around 7 CHF a day you can get complete coverage, which often significantly undercuts the insurance price at the rental desk. If you opt for this, the rental company will still hold a deposit on your credit card, but DiscoverCars’ insurance will reimburse any charges for damage or theft. And that's it.
