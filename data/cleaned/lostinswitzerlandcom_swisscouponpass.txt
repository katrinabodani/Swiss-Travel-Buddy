Is the Digital Swiss Coupon Pass worth it? Most coupons offer a 2-for-1 deal. So if you're travelling on your own, I'd say don't get the pass. Unless you want to be prepared if you make some new friends along the way you'd like to share your discounts with. But if you already know you'll be travelling with someone else and are planning on visiting certain places included in the pass, then yes. It's definitely worth it. For example, if you plan on visiting the Maison Cailler chocolate factory and use the 2-for-1 coupon, you'll already have saved 17 CHF. Visit one more attraction with a similar discount and you'll have paid for your Swiss Coupon Pass. Even if you travel with a Swiss Travel Pass , the coupon pass can still be lucrative for you. Some places might already be completely covered with the Swiss Travel Pass. But there are still plenty of additional deals. I think the Swiss Coupon Pass can be quite a handy companion for your trip to Switzerland.
