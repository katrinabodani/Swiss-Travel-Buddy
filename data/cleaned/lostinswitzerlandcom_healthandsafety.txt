Switzerland is one of the safest countries in the world but itâ€™s always good to be informed about health and safety aspects before your trip. Whether you're hiking in the Alps, exploring Swiss cities or enjoying winter sports, hereâ€™s everything you need to know to stay safe and healthy while visiting Switzerland. Health considerations in Switzerland Swiss healthcare system Switzerland has an excellent healthcare system with world-class hospitals and well-trained medical professionals. If you need medical assistance, youâ€™ll find pharmacies in every city and town with many open late or offering emergency services. If you're looking for a 24/7 pharmacy, go to your nearest bigger train station. Especially in major cities, there are farmacies that are open around the clock. Hospitals and clinics provide high-quality care but medical treatment can be expensive if you donâ€™t have insurance. Health insurance for travellers While Swiss residents are required to have health insurance, travellers should ensure they have adequate coverage. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) covers EU and EEA citizens for essential medical care but itâ€™s still advisable to have travel insurance that includes medical expenses, especially if you plan on doing adventure activities like paragliding , canyoning or river rafting . Emergency numbers In case of an emergency, make sure you have the following numbers handy. Medical emergency: 144 Police: 117 Fire department: 118 Rega air rescue: 1414 Tox info Suisse (poison control): 145 Common health concerns Sun exposure: UV rays can be strong even in winter. Use sunscreen and wear sunglasses. Especially if you're up in the mountains or on a lake. Tick bites: In forested areas, ticks can carry diseases such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Use insect repellent and check your skin after hikes. People can also get vaccinated ahead of their trip if they like. You can check a map of tick-spread areas here . Tap water: Swiss tap water is among the cleanest in the world and safe to drink everywhere. What I wouldn't recommend doing is drinking from lakes, rives and creeks. While the water is still very clean, there's no guarantee you won't get a stomach ache. I hate to admit that I speak from experience...ðŸ˜‰ Altitude sickness: If youâ€™re visiting high-altitude areas like Jungfraujoch or Gornergrat , take time to acclimatise and stay hydrated. Other than that, if you're not going up to very high places during your trip, you won't need to worry about that. The air at Jungfraujoch is quite thin and might cause some nausea if you're not used to the height. The same goes for Gornergrat near Zermatt... Safety in Switzerland Crime and personal safety Switzerland has very low crime rates and violent crime is rare. However, petty theft, particularly pickpocketing, can occur in tourist hotspots like train stations and busy streets in Zurich, Geneva and Lucerne. Stay aware of your belongings especially in crowded areas. Public transport safety Swiss public transport is extremely safe and reliable. But still... Always keep an eye on your luggage especially at major train stations. Road safety Roads in Switzerland are well-maintained and driving is generally safe. However, winter driving requires caution due to icy conditions especially in mountainous regions. Pedestrians have priority at crosswalks and drivers are generally respectful but always look both ways before crossing. Outdoor and adventure safety Hiking and mountain safety Hiking in Switzerland is a rewarding experience, but preparation is key to ensuring a safe trip. Always check the weather forecast before setting off, as conditions in the mountains can change rapidly. Wear sturdy, weather-appropriate clothing and hiking boots . Also bring enough food and water , as some trails may not have easily accessible facilities. Stick to marked trails and avoid venturing off-path to prevent getting lost or encountering hazardous terrain. If you plan to go on a long hike, inform someone of your route and expected return time. Carrying a map, a fully charged phone and a basic first aid kit can also enhance your safety. Make sure you prepare for your time in the mountains. It's safer to hike with someone else than alone. Winter sports safety Switzerlandâ€™s ski resorts are among the best in the world, but skiing and snowboarding come with risks. Always stay on marked slopes , as off-piste skiing can be dangerous due to hidden obstacles and avalanche risks. Wearing a helmet is strongly recommended to prevent head injuries in case of falls or collisions. Familiarise yourself with avalanche warning levels and adhere to any closures or safety advisories from local authorities. If you plan to ski off-piste, consider purchasing rescue insurance, as mountain rescue services can be costly. Staying within your skill level and being aware of other skiers and snowboarders will help ensure a safe and enjoyable experience. Skiing on the marked slopes is safer than off-piste. Follow the sign posts and you'll be fine ðŸ˜‰ Natural disasters and environmental risks Switzerland is not prone to major natural disasters but landslides, avalanches and sudden weather changes in the mountains can be hazardous. Always check local warnings and follow advice from authorities. Conclusion Switzerland is a very safe destination with an excellent healthcare system but being prepared can help ensure a smooth trip. Travel insurance, basic precautions and respecting natureâ€™s power are key to staying safe and healthy while exploring this beautiful country. Whether you're strolling through Swiss cities or scaling mountain peaks, being informed is the best way to enjoy a worry-free experience.
